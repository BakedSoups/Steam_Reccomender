Game: The Midnight Walk
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-midnight-walk-review
Verdict: I haven’t been able to stop thinking about The Midnight Walk since I saw its endings. It’s something I know I’ll come back to so that I can wander this dark world again. Not because I’m looking to complete a checklist, but because everything I’ve learned has recontextualized the emotional stories I saw and changed what I believed about the world. I want to hear the mournful, haunting music again, and spend more time by the fire with these characters. I want to travel with Potboy, my charge, my companion, my friend who says so much without ever speaking a word. The Midnight Walk is not long — I would put my playthrough at around seven or eight hours, and I took my time — but it is gorgeous and touching, and it took hold of me early and never let me go until I took the last step on my journey. It isn’t mechanically ambitious other than to play with perception in unexpected ways, and it challenged me to go into the dark unafraid, and find truth, and companionship, and I did. Out of darkness, light. One cannot exist without the other, and neither offers every answer. I lit a match, and found my way, and I was not alone.
================================================================================

Game: La Quimera Early Access
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/la-quimera-review-early-access
Verdict: La Quimera is bad, but it’s also a perfect example of how even something bad can have a bit of charm. The writing is cringey, the acting is embarrassing, and the middling but serviceable action tends to follow the same basic loop on repeat – but if some friends are riding this partially derailed train with you, there is still some fun to be found here. It doesn’t quite hit “so bad, it’s good” levels of jank, but it could still be a decent candidate for an evening of goofs. That said, even going into it with the right expectations, I wish there was any story resolution whatsoever, as La Quimera is clearly unfinished in more ways than one.
================================================================================

Game: Shotgun Cop Man
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/shotgun-cop-man-review
Verdict: Shotgun Cop Man is a left field nostalgia trip that hits just about every shot from the volley it unloads — from its engaging, refined movement to its distinct level design ideas to its compelling time trials. That makes it all the more disappointing that it’s missing a couple of load-bearing features for any game that’s all about sanding down your runs to the last second, like a way to quickly restart from the start of a level after each death. Still, using firearms to fly through the air is a total blast, and I’m excited to get back to chasing better times and more precise runs through the underworld.
================================================================================

Game: Tempest Rising
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-multiplayer
Verdict: Tempest Rising’s multiplayer mode is a better looking but anemic version of the same exact style of RTS multiplayer we've been playing for 30 years. There's certainly value in that, since Command & Conquer’s fast-paced strategic action still holds up as well as ever, and matches are quick and tense when you’re up against an evenly skilled opponent. It may be a minimum viable product with only two factions and a handful of maps, but it is viable, and it remains a good time to duke it out as GDF and Dynasty with others or bots.
================================================================================

Game: Oblivion Remastered
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review
Verdict: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is an awesome nostalgic adventure that recaptures most of what I loved about the 2006 original, while sanding down many of its roughest edges. The result is a fantastic open-world RPG that’s aged quite well, with questlines and stories that are better than I remembered, modernizations (like the slightly improved leveling system) that remove some of the friction of the original, and loads of opportunities to make this adventure whatever you want it to be via the plentiful freedom afforded to you. On the downside, not enough has been done to make this thing significantly less buggy than it notoriously was back in the day, and some choices – like the enemy scaling and procedural Oblivion levels that become dull fast – have not been improved, which feels like a squandered opportunity. Even so, I never expected to so thoroughly enjoy replaying through this uniquely goofy RPG, and I am so, so glad I took this walk down memory lane (now with the option to sprint down it).
================================================================================

Game: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review
Verdict: In so many ways, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reminded me of numerous classic and contemporary RPGs I love, but developer Sandfall truly understood why those games are special and made the pieces it borrowed its own. The creative turn-based combat system is brilliant, keeping me engaged while impressive visual flourishes bring it all together. The story can be a touch messy or melodramatic at times, but there’s an earnestness to how it frames mortality, grief, and the small moments of joy we find. It doesn’t shy away from the different, destructive ways we may handle loss, either – all of which is delivered through fantastic performances from an A-list cast that give its story the heart it needs to really hit. The contrast between its artistic sensibilities and old-school RPG design philosophy shows a clarity of vision, as if it was scoped just right to focus on the things that matter most, making it a true modern throwback. And so, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 stands strong alongside its inspirations, and I hope that it too can be an inspiration for those who come after.
================================================================================

Game: Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mandragora-whispers-of-the-witch-tree-review
Verdict: Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree is an interesting Frankenstein of action-RPG ideas that never quite comes to life. It’s easy to see the potential in everything from the grim and creepy setting, to the 2D soulslike mechanics, to the metroidvania exploration – but the actual execution of each is only skin deep, trying to juggle too many things at once and falling short for all of them. The intricate RPG systems and character classes do a lot of the heavy lifting for the otherwise subpar action, but even that can’t disguise the dull and repetitive combat, with weak boss fights that serve as flaccid finales to each level. There are plenty of good ideas in the dark fantasy world of Faelduum, but none of them come together in the way I’d hoped.
================================================================================

Game: Steel Seed
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/steel-seed-review
Verdict: Steel Seed is cursed by mediocrity. Its combat is a low point, so abrasive that I’d rather restart whole areas when I got caught rather than have to navigate its jank. But it’s real problem is that everything else, from the bland characters and predictable story, to the forgettable locations that the tale takes you through, to the initially fun stealth sections that eventually wear thin, will lose the fight for a spot in my memory as soon as I’m done with this review. That’s a real shame, because there are a small handful of shiny chrome moments to find here, but they are buried under a whole lot of rust.
================================================================================

Game: Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-review
Verdict: When it comes to all the most important parts of a fighting game, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is up there with the best of the genre. Its fighting system is a wonderful update to the classic SNK style of one-on-one combat that feels similar to Street Fighter 6, but just different enough to exist as an alternative to it; the roster of 17 is varied and interesting, even with the strange addition of two real life guest characters; and its netcode, while not on the same level as games like Street Fighter 6 and Guilty Gear Strive, is at least relatively close to it. Many things around that rock solid center are a bit behind the times, from the bare minimum teaching tools to an ugly menu UI that can be frustrating to engage with. But while that means Fatal Fury has some cobwebs to shake off from its 25-year hibernation, the end result is still an excellent return to the fighting game scene.
================================================================================

Game: Tempest Rising
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign
Verdict: Tempest Rising’s two good-sized single-player campaigns are a large helping of comfort food for RTS fans old enough to remember Command & Conquer in its heyday, and a way for everyone else to sample a classic style we don’t see very often anymore without having to deal with any creaky old technology. Its nature as an homage to those games does mean that it’s not terribly ambitious when it comes to doing anything bold you won’t have seen before, but it does put its own interesting spin on faction design that kept me experimenting with abilities throughout the campaigns and prevented it from feeling like too much of a retread. The main place it disappointed an old C&C fan like myself was in its straight-faced mission briefings that can’t compare to the B-movie goofiness and memorable characters of the games that inspired it.
================================================================================

Game: Schedule 1 Early Access
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/schedule-1-review-early-access
Verdict: Schedule 1 is a crime sim that mashes its dark subject matter and dirty jokes with surprisingly cozy management mechanics in a way that works really well, resulting in an extremely unique and highly amusing crafting game I happily sunk 40 hours into. Befriending my neighbors while getting them hooked on addictive substances grown in an apartment above a chinese restaurant is a goofy, satisfying hook, and leveling up my enterprise scratched an automation itch I don’t get to scratch often enough. This Early Access launch inevitably runs out of reasons to keep you playing since it’s quite clearly missing the back half of its campaign for now, and it has some bugs that give it a decidedly unpolished feel, but I still had a blast being an absolutely terrible human in the comfiest way possible.
================================================================================

Game: Commandos: Origins
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review
Verdict: Commandos: Origins strikes a great balance between the classic stealth tactics games and modern streamlined ideas, creating tons of potential for finding creative solutions to problems like “too many living fascists.” Pruning out elements like inventory management may not be to every older fan’s tastes, but that’s focused a spotlight on strict stealth – and it’s here Origins shines. Sneaking through its massive maps, each of which are swarming with hundreds of enemies, takes hours and hours of patient planning and careful clicking. I regularly gleaned a ton of pleasure from executing a perfect coordinated strike and fading away into the background, with the remaining Nazis none the wiser. No plan survives contact with this many bugs, but quick-loading will get you past nearly any issue and this otherwise might be the sneakiest fun you can have going commando with your underwear on.
================================================================================

Game: Blue Prince
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review
Verdict: Blue Prince is the kind of puzzle game that dug deep into my brain and didn’t let go. Its complex mysteries weave brilliantly into the careful decision making of how to lay out the mansion’s rooms on each randomized run, leaving me building floorplans in my sleep almost every night after I played it. The story that slowly emerges within this fascinating place is also a compelling one, and it had me hungrily hunting for clues and combinations for many hours after I reached the credits while also poetically tying into the mechanics that lead you to them. Hitting a dead end you did everything in your power to avoid can frustrate from time to time, but this sprawling estate has so much to uncover that the randomness never stalled my progress for too long. If The Witness, Portal, and Myst are already emblazoned on the Mount Rushmore of first-person puzzle games, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Blue Prince carved alongside them soon enough.
================================================================================

Game: South of Midnight
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review
Verdict: South of Midnight is a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming. It’s focused, filling out its 12-hour runtime nicely without ever dragging or relying on unnecessary padding. Beyond those basics, however, is a certain heart and artistry that elevates the whole package, inviting you to peer into the deep American South through its folklore, nature, and culture. It might not be the most profound exploration of family life, but it’s delivered in ways that feel authentic. From its striking art style to the evocative tunes that bring big story moments together, Hazel’s journey is a captivating one no matter where you come from.
================================================================================

Game: The First Berserker: Khazan
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-berserker-khazan-review
Verdict: After finding my footing and gaining some abilities that made me feel like I could stand a chance against anything, I came to love The First Beserker: Khazan’s devastating bosses. They’re the reason to play this brutal but impressive soulslike, and they only get better and more mechanically satisfying as you go. It can be a steep and demoralizing climb, especially in the early hours, but there’s an exhilaration in executing split-second guards and dodges to escape relentless attacks before hitting my foes with my own flurry of steel. Learning to take on the worst Khazan threw at me at the start gave me the confidence to press on, and I’m so glad I kept with it. The First Berserker: Khazan is undoubtedly the hardest game I’ve played this year, but it’s one I encourage fans of the genre (or even those just curious about it) to play. The journey is tough, and it won’t be for everyone – but if I can get through it, with plenty of time and practice, you can too.
================================================================================

Game: Bleach Rebirth of Souls
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review
Verdict: Bleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat surpasses the typical anime arena fighter thanks to its intricate battle system and the effort that has been invested in making each character feel unique with their distinct play styles. Although the theatrics of its story mode do not consistently match the spectacle of its crisp character models, the vibrant sword slashes and stylish typography accompanying each super move help compensate for those shortcomings. Despite not fully delivering on its ambitious promise to elevate anime arena fighters to new heights, Rebirth of Souls is still a welcome latecomer to the genre for this series.
================================================================================

Game: in
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-review-early-access
Verdict: inZOI is by no means perfect, but it is impressive. It’s Early Access launch is a mish-mash of unfinished ideas and engaging mechanics, and I am at least still finding little surprises 30 hours in. The character creator and build mode are already complex and relatively user-friendly, and the Karma system is a clever way to introduce drama into the world, but inconsistent behaviours across its uncanny locations and conversation topics don’t put those good ideas in the best light. What inZOI offers right now is an enticing slice of something that could eventually be great, and it’s worthwhile enough if your main interest is curating realistic dioramas to pose your custom Zois in like dolls. However, if you're looking for the moment-to-moment depth of something like The Sims, you’ll need to let Krafton keep cooking for some time yet.
================================================================================

Game: Wreckfest 2 Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckfest-2-early-access-review
Verdict: As a huge fan of developer Bugbear since the original FlatOut in 2004, Wreckfest 2 is definitely already speaking my language – and it really does feel great when you’re in the thick of it, crashing and carving your way through rival cars and destructible scenery on a scale I’ve never seen before. The slim amount of content and abundant crashes to desktop in the early access launch, however, make Wreckfest 2 in its current form more of an investment in what’s to come than an imperative you should change course to experience today. It leaves a mark on first impact, but a few sessions later and I feel like I’ve squeezed all the fun I’m going to glean out of it for now.
================================================================================

Game: Atomfall
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/atomfall-review
Verdict: Atomfall is a gripping survival-action adventure that takes some of the best elements of Fallout and Elden Ring, and synthesises them into its own fresh mutation. It presents a picturesque chunk of English countryside littered with alluring structures to pique and reward your curiosity, eccentric locals to meet, and absorbing mysteries to unravel, and uses classic iconography from British sci-fi and horror to consistently unsettling effect. In spite of some enemy behaviours that are occasionally less stable than a reactor in meltdown, Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take.
================================================================================

Game: Kaiserpunk
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/kaiserpunk-review
Verdict: While it has some cool ideas, a unique aesthetic, and often rewarding production chain management, Kaiserpunk definitely is not ready for the front lines in its current state. There are huge, save-killing bugs. The interface lacks what I would consider to be some fairly basic functionality. And the often strong city-building layer doesn't harmonize well at all with the over-scoped and cumbersome strategic map. Maybe some substantial patches could theoretically let me recommend Kaiserpunk on its strengths as a city builder with a novel premise. But for now, I can't even really do that. The trenches may have vanished under the plow, but playing Kaiserpunk still leaves me feeling shell-shocked.
================================================================================

Game: Assassin's Creed Shadows
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review
Verdict: Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip.
================================================================================

Game: FragPunk
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-review
Verdict: In the heat of the action, FragPunk feels great. The hilariously mad Shard Cards make every round distinct, and with so many potential combinations, it is hard to imagine its signature game mode growing tiresome any time soon. It’s just a shame that the economy and reward systems built around it are such a mess, and the unlockables that you are supposed to work towards earning aren’t very interesting. It’s still exciting to play, especially when all eyes fall on you in a match-ending Duel – but when the thrill of victory alone loses its luster, there isn’t a compelling reason to stick around for the long haul unless what you earn and how you earn it changes significantly.
================================================================================

Game: Wanderstop
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/wanderstop-review
Verdict: Every inch of Wanderstop pushes the conventions you’d expect of similarly wholesome games. Its vibrant colors, quirky characters, and enchanting music are used to tell a compelling story that forces you to grapple with both its lead character's insecurities as well as your own. It’s a powerful adventure not just about burn out, but about how deeply painful it is to free ourselves from coping mechanisms that may have previously kept us secure. At the same time, Wanderstop’s simple but satisfying tea brewing experimentation serves as a safe and entertaining space to do that deep digging. There aren’t many games like Wanderstop out there currently, but for all our sakes, I hope there will be soon.
================================================================================

Game: Carmen Sandiego
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/carmen-sandiego-review
Verdict: Carmen Sandiego’s latest adventure harkens back to the series’ origins while modernizing it in a few key ways. It could do with some refinement, as some of the activities are more fun than others, but it’s overall an enjoyable (if simple) detective game that will test your knowledge and tease your brain. For kids, Carmen Sandiego offers an age-appropriate challenge that makes learning entertaining — just like the edutainment genre set out to do so many years ago. For kids at heart, it’s a breezy adventure that’s worth dusting off your virtual passport and taking another trip around the world.
================================================================================

Game: Split Fiction
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review
Verdict: An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss.
================================================================================

Game: Two Point Museum
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review
Verdict: Two Point Museum is a rewarding, deep, challenging, and highly entertaining tycoon game that demonstrates Two Point Studios has really hit its groove with this third iteration of the idea. The variety of different exhibits to unlock and level up, the thrill of discovering new expedition maps, and the array of clever and easy-to-use management tools make designing and running a museum joyful and consistently rewarding. I've sunk more than 40 hours into it already and I could easily see doubling that without running out of stuff to do. Call the curator. They're really going to want to take a look at this.
================================================================================

Game: Warriors: Abyss
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/warriors-abyss-review
Verdict: Warriors: Abyss may stumble in its open-ended, cookie-cutter story and cut-and-paste boss battles, but the replayability that comes from its combat and the customization of its multitude of characters and builds helped keep me slashing through thousands of enemies for dozens of hours of roguelite runs. It's always great to see a long-running series like Dynasty Warriors experimenting with new genres because it often leads to innovation, and Abyss does succeed overall with adapting the ideas of a massive roster of characters and over-the-top Mousu action. However, not enough of the other elements of a genuinely excellent action roguelite line up here to make it the kind I return to for months.
================================================================================

Game: Monster Hunter Wilds
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review
Verdict: Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the traditionally rough edges of the series in smart ways, reducing as much friction as possible that could get in the way of you grabbing any of its exceptionally fun weapons and planting them firmly in a monster’s hide. But in that quest to make Monster Hunter more approachable, Wilds has carved a little too close to the bone in some places, trimming its challenge back so much that I barely needed to dig into its in-depth equipment system at all this time to become an apex predator. Its more flexible combat is some of the most fun I’ve had with the series, but like the blustering lighting storms of its gorgeous desert, it'll burns brightly but briefly until Capcom unleashes some real endgame beasts to challenge us.
================================================================================

Game: Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review
Verdict: Propelled by a breezy and often completely bananas treasure-hunting tale, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a delightful spin-off that seamlessly shifts between street thuggery and skulduggery. Majima’s Sea Dog stance is one of the most fun and flexible fighting styles I’ve enjoyed in the series to date – at least in its classic, combo-based form – and I welcomed the challenge of carefully balancing my crew lineup in order to survive the many turbulent naval battles. While its overworld maps feel a little padded out with recycled island settings, Honolulu itself is jammed with unpredictable substories and overhauled activities that meant every moment of shore leave was full of surprises. Absolutely heaving with buried treasures and varied pleasures, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a consistently captivating voyage that kept my timbers shivering whether on land or at sea.
================================================================================

Game: Avowed
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review
Verdict: With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian’s RPGs in the first place. However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that’s more familiar than evolutionary, and there’s bear-ly any enemy variety to keep its swords-and-sorcery battles interesting for long. Even if it doesn’t swing for the fences or leave a memorable mark on the genre, though, it’s still perfectly competent with all the tried-and-true stuff I expect, including chaotic combat, leveling systems and a loot progression that lets you build the kind of character you want to play, and meaningful decisions that can have a massive impact on the world. Plus, the whole thing’s surprisingly technically stable compared to its reliably unreliable peers. I enjoyed my time parkouring my way through Eora and think you will too – just don’t expect Avowed to show you anything you haven’t seen before.
================================================================================

Game: Synduality Echo of Ada
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review
Verdict: Synduality Echo of Ada is a tense extraction shooter with a cool sci-fi premise. Its mech-based action plays well, but the early grind is an absolute slog and upgrades are always slow to unlock, even if you’re not dying much. My drive to play even started to die after a while because I was forced to do the same things on repeat. But I powered through that part and I’m ultimately glad I did, because what comes after that slow opening is great. There’s nothing quite like smoking some poor sucker who picks a fight with you in single combat. Oh, and if you’re rolling with stuff you really like, please buy insurance. It’s a scam, but it may save your life – or at least your mech. And in the world of Synduality, that’s really all you have.
================================================================================

Game: The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-2-review
Verdict: The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak 2 makes a few missteps with the pacing and structure of its multiversal story, but it’s buoyed by a focus on quality character moments and impressive worldbuilding over earthshaking reveals. The turn-based combat and party customization haven’t changed much at all, but they didn’t really need to, and the real-time action side of things has seen some small but meaningful improvements. Daybreak 2 didn’t move the needle in the overall Calvard saga as much as I hoped, but this more personal story is still another good entry in the Trails series overall.
================================================================================

Game: Tokyo Xtreme Racer Early Access
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tokyo-xtreme-racer-early-access-review
Verdict: Tokyo Xtreme Racer is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing.
================================================================================

Game: Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review
Verdict: In many ways, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 feels like it’s picked up and run with the reactive first-person RPG torch that Bethesda left lying in the mud years ago in pursuit of a broader audience. And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it's not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn't get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story.
================================================================================

Game: Civilization 7
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review
Verdict: With Civilization 7, the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface. It’s frustratingly inadequate at providing me with the information I need to play well, or even understand what's going on sometimes. Even so, it does have improved warfare and diplomacy, a bit of added narrative flair, as well as mostly gorgeous graphics and sound, so it can still give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night. There’s good reason to believe that with Firaxis’s usual pace of patches and expansions it can refine its new ideas and become everything it ought to be, and while what’s here right now is at least still a fun time, it’s also a bigger step backward for the series than we’re accustomed to when a new age dawns.
================================================================================

Game: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review
Verdict: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging.
================================================================================

Game: Hello Kitty Island Adventure
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-review
Verdict: For fans of Sanrio's lovable cast of characters, Hello Kitty Island Adventure might scratch an itch left in the wake of Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the broadest sense. On the surface, its large and colorful world, cutesy critters, and never-ending to-do list feel energetic and new. But sadly, that surface is all there is. A shallow pool of endless gifting and mindless tasks are locked behind daily progression gates to distract you from the fact that you are, in fact, never getting anywhere fast.
================================================================================

Game: Assetto Corsa Evo Early Access
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review
Verdict: Assetto Corsa Evo already feels absolutely fantastic behind the wheel but, with aggravating AI opponents slamming into you every which way and hamstrung as it is by online-only features that are currently inaccessible, it doesn’t feel like an essential early access purchase. The handling may be excellent, but I’ll be parking it up and waiting for the finished product – including the promised epic-sized map of Germany – before I put the keys back in the ignition.
================================================================================

Game: Ninja Gaiden 2 Black
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review
Verdict: Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over the Sigma 2 release, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. If this really is it for Ninja Gaiden 2, it will at least go out on a high note. This trip through time reminded me that while you can't go home again, and nothing will ever truly be like it was, that doesn't mean something can't still be beautiful. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black.

Game: Rift of the NecroDancer
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review
Verdict: I could wear out my keyboard slapping arrow keys to the beat and jamming in my seat to Rift of the NecroDancer’s excellent soundtrack, fervently chasing down a perfect run of a song for hours. Whether I was fighting stuffy puppet masters, rhythmically ridding the world of monsters, or just waddling around in a silly mole costume, it provides many excellent flavors of arcade-style rhythm action. Even though this “Greatest Hits” anthology isn’t as focused or Earth-shattering as Brace Yourself Games’ genre-bending debut album, it still continually surprised and delighted me by providing clever twists on time-tested mechanics.
================================================================================

Game: The Stone of Madness
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stone-of-madness-review
Verdict: The Stone of Madness has some excellent art and great moments of sneaking around. But what should have been a fairly replayable and interesting prison break ends up buckling under the weight of its technical problems. Progress-halting bugs, graphical issues, and finicky controls all turn otherwise-engaging sneaking missions into frustrating excursions. With some extra tuning, The Stone of Madness could be a refreshing take on tactical stealth. As-is, there are too many obstacles getting in the way of what’s good here.
================================================================================

Game: Eternal Strands
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/eternal-strands-review
Verdict: When Eternal Strands is good, it’s very good, thanks to exciting boss fights that iterate upon Shadow of Colossus’s gigantic encounters better than just about any of the other games that have used it as inspiration. While its story is underwhelming and some aspects of its gear progression are especially convoluted, the combat is built on an extremely strong foundation thanks to a versatile set of powers that encourage and reward creativity, especially in the showstopping Great Foe battles. The novelty does begin to fade after a while, especially when you’re forced to fight those same bosses and enemies again in the same locations, occasionally with frustrating weather effects, but the high points of Eternal Strands mitigate the low points enough to still make it an action RPG that’s easy to recommend.
================================================================================

Game: Sniper Elite: Resistance
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/sniper-elite-resistance-review
Verdict: Sniper Elite: Resistance is a modest retread for the Sniper Elite series, rather than an exaggerated goose step forward. A near total lack of innovation makes Resistance seem like little more than a Sniper Elite 5 remix, rehashing everything from the skill tree to the traps and enemy types, and serving up some sniping sandboxes that are for the most part a bit too similar to locations that have featured in the series’ prior entries. Its bonus propaganda missions are fun but fleeting, and its X-ray kill-cam still blasts balls and brains to bits but no longer blows my mind. Those only just getting on board with the series will undoubtedly find a bit more to like, but I’d argue that on balance, Sniper Elite 5’s superior story sandboxes and otherwise similar feature set makes it a much better buy even three years on from its release. Sniper Elite: Resistance is a solid stealth-based shooter, but it fails to set its sights high enough in order to pull off a truly spectacular execution.
================================================================================

Game: Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-review
Verdict: Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap's roguelite spin on the action-tower defense series works pretty well. Even if most of its traps and endless parade of highly killable enemies are carried over from past games, the new Warmages' abilities and the combined impact of its randomized modifiers can really shake things up nicely for quite a few runs. Puzzling out how to steer the orcs to their doom and then taking part in the bloody carnage is as much fun here as it is in the rest of the series. I did lose steam due to the slow meta progression and the increasingly long series of missions where the first ones are too easy and the latter ones got frustrating because of bullet-sponge enemies, but that was only after a few dozen hours of happily chewing up orcs and spitting them out both solo and in co-op.
================================================================================

Game: Hyper Light Breaker Early Access
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-review-early-access
Verdict: At its early access launch, Hyper Light Breaker is a sloppy roguelite that makes poor use of the Hyper Light world I adore. Combat is messy and repetitive, bosses are cheesy and frustrating as all get out, the procedural worlds feel awkward to explore, and both loot and progression are half-baked. Cover all of that in a thick layer of the usual work-in-progress technical problems, and you’ve got yourself a particularly rough package, even when accompanied by friends. Riding around on a hoverboard while taking in the colorful scenery can give way to some enjoyable moments, so I’ve still found reasons to be hopeful things could be polished to a more impressive shine over the course of Hyper Light Breaker’s early access development. But for now, you might want to wait and see if there’s a hyper light at the end of this tunnel.
================================================================================

Game: Aloft Early Access
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/aloft-review-early-access
Verdict: Aloft is a promising blend of a survival crafting game and cozy sensibilities with a memorable airborne setting, but it misses the mark in quite a few other places as of its early access launch. Turning any floating island into your own personal flying pirate ship is very satisfying, and mixing survival mechanics with low-stakes, feel-good charm is a potent combination. That said, with weak and repetitive combat encounters, a scarcity of things to keep you busy, and loads of technical issues, there’s a lot of room left for improvement that can be a little tough to endure at the moment. There are enough good ideas here that I’m optimistic Aloft could be quite worth your time at some point in the future, but right now you might want to wait for stronger winds to blow before setting sail.
================================================================================

Game: Dynasty Warriors: Origins
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review
Verdict: If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back.
================================================================================

Game: Alien: Rogue Incursion
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review
Verdict: Alien: Rogue Incursion is a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is. But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting part two.
================================================================================

Game: Mouthwashing
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mouthwashing-review
Verdict: Mouthwashing is grimy, uncomfortable, and incredibly compelling. The genuinely unpleasant actions you’re forced to perform may be deeply unsettling (and at times a little frustrating), but they aren't gratuitous, used to make powerful points in a way games are uniquely suited to. Combine that with a smart lo-fi visual style, eerily muffled sound design, and simple but direct writing and Mouthwashing paints a picture of who we can be in our worst moments – and it doesn’t let us get away with it.
================================================================================

Game: Delta Force
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-review-2024
Verdict: Delta Force isn’t the best extraction shooter, nor does it do big PvP battles the best. However, doing both of those modes reasonably well in one free-to-play package is pretty unique. The massive, vehicle-filled battles are respectable fun – especially in Attack and Defend – as long as you can get comfortable with the more realistic shooting mechanics and how they mix with fantastical powers. The Operations, meanwhile, make for one of the most formulaic and accessible extraction shooters I’ve played, though the great levels are wasted on too much direction toward the only worthwhile loot, and upgrading the Black Site is more of a chore than an aspiration. Still, it’s a good option for either, and deserves credit for doing a solid, if unspectacular and not especially imaginative job, of two very different first-person shooter styles.
================================================================================

Game: Marvel Rivals
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review
Verdict: Neither the MCU nor the hero shooter genre are at the glorious heights experienced by both in the past decade, but that isn’t stopping Marvel Rivals from doing everything it can to be a success story today. Approachable, yet with a high skill ceiling to reach for, it's consistently a great time no matter which fan-favourite comic book character and accompanying skillset is at your fingertips. It may be following closely in the slipstream of the hero shooters that have come before it, but by doing so Rivals has firmly placed itself in a strong position to take the crown for itself.
================================================================================

Game: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review
Verdict: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind nails the look and feel of both Power Rangers and the classic arcade games it’s drawing inspiration from. While the Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag, they sing when they work, and they’re still only manageably frustrating when they don’t. Everything else, though, rules — the gorgeous sprite work, bumping soundtrack, rock-solid beat ‘em up gameplay, in-jokes for fans, and other little touches like playable in-universe arcade games. And while nostalgia will certainly enhance the experience for some, you don’t have to know your Green Ranger from your Black Ranger to enjoy it. It might even give you an itch to revisit the classic games, or give the original television series a watch. You may not be able to go down to your local arcade anymore, but if Rita’s Rewind is any indication, you can always go back in time. Just pack some spandex.
================================================================================

Game: Path of Exile 2 Early Access
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-review-early-access
Verdict: At its early access launch, Path of Exile 2 is already shaping up to be the sequel we’ve been waiting for. Everything from the refined fundamental action-RPG gameplay to the surprisingly fleshed-out endgame has seen major improvements, and the half of the story we’ve got so far shows plenty of promise, even if the setting feels a little generic in the realm of dark fantasy worlds. The downside of playing in early access, though, is that you’ll have to slog through all three acts twice to reach the endgame, the loot game needs some major tweaking to more consistently reward us with usable items, and some mild-to-severe technical wonkiness might take the wind out of your sails if things go awry – but it’s nothing that makes me concerned for the future of this expansive sequel. Even while we wait for 1.0, Path of Exile 2 is already a stellar way to lose dozens of hours and a clear leap forward for the series.
================================================================================

Game: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review
Verdict: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nails nearly everything about the best parts of the storied franchise upon which it’s based, from the title card and location fonts to Harrison Ford’s finger waggle, but its successes go way beyond its faithfulness to the finer points of the films. With a host of gorgeous and lavishly detailed levels, satisfying combat hinged on jawbreaking haymakers, and a focus on slow-paced exploration, platforming, and puzzle solving (interspersed with a handful of high-voltage action scenes), The Great Circle is an irresistible and immersive global treasure hunt for Indy fans who’ve felt underserved by the likes of The Dial of Destiny and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Moreover, it sets itself apart from this decade’s increasingly homogenised third-person action games by opting for a classic first-person perspective inspired by the likes of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. If you butt your head against its generally basic stealth systems, cracks will show – but when played as intended, The Great Circle immediately ranks amongst the best Indiana Jones games ever and its story is closer to Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade than anything that’s come after. Some pundits may claim it belongs in a museum, but museums are for dusty old relics you shouldn’t ever touch. The Great Circle doesn’t belong in a museum; it belongs on your hard drive where you can play the heck out of it.
================================================================================

Game: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review
Verdict: We have hit cruising altitude. You can safely unbuckle your seatbelts and move freely about the cabin. I was extremely skeptical as to whether or not Asobo could capture the lightning in a bottle of 2020’s Microsoft Flight Simulator again – but after Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 took the time to clean up its launch problems and I really got to know its new features, I am once again astonished. It's more than just simulating the experience of flying: you can use it to learn the technical side of how pilots actually fly planes, including the stuff that doesn't involve ailerons and elevators and trim thanks to the EFB and Flight Planner. When I encounter some new term I don't understand, all it does is make me want to learn more so I can fly virtual airplanes on a digital twin of the planet Earth with as much realism as is possible. It's not flawless, with some lingering problems in those new systems and tutorials that are lacking (or worse, nonexistent, making Google a constant companion). But I am still in awe of what's here, and I cannot wait to spend hundreds of hours exploring it.
================================================================================

Game: Infinity Nikki
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review
Verdict: Infinity Nikki is the ultimate evolution of the incredibly successful series that came before it. It is the peak free-to-play dress-up game, and while it’s still full of a few too many currencies and all the gacha pulls you’d expect from its mobile roots, it's all in service of building a gorgeous, gigantic wardrobe worth getting excited about. It features some of the most intricate, detailed outfits in any game I've seen, and while unlocking them can require a lot of grinding (or some real-world money) depending on the outfit, that just means time spent joyfully exploring its packed open world. There's always something new and either cute or bizarrely dark to discover, and even after dozens of hours I'm still unraveling its secrets. Infinity Nikki is perfectly girly positivity rolled up in a pink and sparkling package, and regardless of if that is something you've wanted, it might just be what you need.
================================================================================

Game: Dragon Quest
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review
Verdict: Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is the best-case scenario for a faithful remake of a classic roleplaying game, and a shining example for developers to follow when setting out to revisit old, beloved adventures. It spruces up the 36-year-old original with great quality-of-life improvements that enhance the journey without unrecognizably transforming it, along with a beautiful new coat of paint that proves Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style are a perfect match. But it only works as well as it does because Dragon Quest III is still an incredible RPG in its own right, with great turn-based battles, a highly-adaptable class system, and an intriguing world to uncover that’s littered with secrets. There are only a few areas where I wish it felt a bit more modern, like the clunky inventory management and your party’s lack of personality, but I still respect its unflinching dedication to the original’s vision. Remakes may be all the rage right now, but Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake still confidently stands among the best of them, and is a perfect reminder of why the original is one of the most important RPGs in the genre.
================================================================================

Game: Lego Horizon Adventures
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-review
Verdict: Lego Horizon Adventures reimagines Horizon Zero Dawn with a playful Lego twist, simplifying the story while keeping the heart of its key moments and characters. Combat feels great and offers plenty of difficulty options for players of all skill levels. While the randomness of gadgets and rare weapons can be an annoyance, especially when trying to complete certain challenges, it’s cute that the use-what-you-can-find nature of Horizon has been embraced. There are also plenty of customization options for your characters and the hub town, which was enjoyable as I strived to make Mother's Heart my own. Couple that with visually impressive levels full of excellent music but disappointingly predictable level design and a lack of extras and I ultimately found myself having fun with Lego Horizon Adventures even if I was left wanting more.
================================================================================

Game: Empire of the Ants
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-multiplayer-review
Verdict: Empire of the Ants’s multiplayer modes have some clever ideas for how insects do battle, having you scurry around as a commander giving orders and casting buffs on your legions of bugs. Managing its deceptively small-scale battles presents some interesting challenges, and the impressive, hyper-realistic graphics are let down only by animations that grow repetitive after a few matches. What undermines it most is the lack of unit variety and multiplayer modes, which don’t include multiple bug factions or any options to play as a team or against a competent AI. Without that, it’s hard to see this game having a lot of legs.
================================================================================

Game: Empire of the Ants Single
Score: 3
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review
Verdict: While Empire of the Ants’s nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn’t seem to understand crucial mechanics, and those that aren’t are obnoxious because you can’t save mid-mission to replay the tough parts without trudging through the easy setup; Meanwhile, all of the non-combat missions are tedious searches for needles in haystacks and the story fails to make ant politics intriguing. It’s easily the worst single-player campaign I’ve played in years.
================================================================================

Game: Planet Coaster 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review
Verdict: Planet Coaster 2 is even better at all of the things its predecessor was good at. It's a detailer's dream, with a colossal variety of rides, scenery, terrain tools, and sometimes terrifyingly vast options for customization. It's also bad at more or less all of the things the last one was bad at, though, as it still fails to make the financial side of running a park, or even staff management, challenging or enjoyable. But the addition of water attractions alone is enough reason to dive in even if you have hundreds of hours sunk into the first Planet Coaster. All told, it's the best sim of its type your money can buy.
================================================================================

Game: Metal Slug Tactics
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-slug-tactics-review
Verdict: From its lively, cartoonish sprites to its energetic soundtrack, Metal Slug Tactics is a meticulously crafted ode to the arcade classic that never gets lost blindly chasing its adoration for the series without understanding what makes Metal Slug great. Instead, it introduces a handful of distinct innovations to the tactics genre that masterfully meld Metal Slug’s action-packed platforming and shooting onto a tactics grid. Even though it’s hampered by some frustrating bugs, I’m still having plenty of fun with each run as I experiment with new strategies and team compositions.
================================================================================

Game: Slitterhead
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review
Verdict: Slitterhead features some interesting body-swapping exploration and a unique blood-based battle system, but it never fully capitalises on either of them due to its small handful of repeated level settings and largely indistinguishable enemy encounters. Its story is disappointingly primitive in its presentation, and its time-looping structure only really serves as a feeble attempt to mask the fact that it takes about one hour’s worth of story mission ideas and repeats them incessantly across its 13-hour duration. Like a bloody blade worn down by a few too many battles, Slitterhead grows increasingly dull over time and ultimately just doesn’t cut it.
================================================================================

Game: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review
Verdict: I can sum up Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode with a quote from one of the guys I was playing with: “I don’t think I have the right sniper rifle, because enemies aren’t exploding.” He wasn’t being figurative; there’s a sniper rifle that, when upgraded, literally shoots grenades. There are spider monsters that explode from the corpses of dead zombies and hordes so big that, if you’re not careful, they will kill your whole team before one of you can say “please revive me, I have a raygun.” It is absurd and campy and amazing and goofy in all the right ways, and when you clear a map for the first time, that monumental task will have you feeling equal parts exhausted and triumphant. I’m so happy round-based gameplay is back after our brief detour last year, and I love that we have two interesting maps to choose from. There are some annoyances here in terms of bugs, but that hasn’t made me want to stop playing. In fact, I think I’ll hop back into Terminus tonight. There are a couple more Easter Eggs I wanna track down. And who knows? Maybe, eventually, I’ll play the rest of Black Ops 6. But right now, I’ve got zombies to kill.
================================================================================

Game: No More Room in Hell 2 Early Access
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/no-more-room-in-hell-2-review-early-access
Verdict: If you pull back the layers of performance issues and bugs, No More Room in Hell 2 has a lot of potential. It plays around with clever ideas about how to get players to work together through some excellent level design, but those concepts aren’t explored enough yet to make it more than just another co-op survival horror shooter with generic guns and scarce loot. No More Room in Hell 2’s Early Access launch at least allows you to team up with friends for a few chaotic and sometimes fun rounds, but with a single available map that gets repetitive fast and a mountain of serious bugs that cause unexpected problems, it needs a lot more time in the oven. With a slew of hotfixes already arriving and more supposedly on the way, hopefully the flames of hell are hot enough to cook it to perfection down the line, but you should probably wait until they do.
================================================================================

Game: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review
Verdict: With Black Ops 6, Treyarch and Raven Software have taken almost everything I love about the Call of Duty multiplayer experience and given it a beautiful polish. The maps are excellent, built to please almost everyone's favorite gun styles. The meat and potatoes – moving quick and dishing out firepower – is aces this year; it's fast without feeling too twitchy, and the weapons dispatch your opponents in exactly the way you expect them to. The Omnimove system is fun and flashy, which makes for some great highlights but doesn’t completely take over as the best technique for every situation. I do wish there were more new and innovative modes to explore, but that’s about the only thing I feel draws fire other than the initial lack of goofy skins available. Overall, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 shines because although it plays a lot of things safe, it does the fundamentals of multiplayer combat in a way that feels better than it has in a long time. I am having an absolutely awesome time with it.
================================================================================

Game: Life is Strange: Double Exposure
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review
Verdict: After several attempts to recapture what made the original Life is Strange so enduring, developer Deck Nine Games really knocked it out of the park with Life is Strange: Double Exposure. This is a worthy sequel to a game that captured the hearts and minds of millions of people way back in 2015, myself included. The writing is great, the music is excellent, the cinematography and acting are top-notch, and Max’s new powers are a fun and intuitive fit for its murder mystery structure.
================================================================================

Game: Dragon Age: The Veilguard
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review
Verdict: Dragon Age: The Veilguard refreshes and reinvigorates a storied series that stumbled through its middle years, and leaves no doubt that it deserves its place in the RPG pantheon. The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure. Enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of allies with sweeping story arcs all their own, top-notch cinematics, and moving, nuanced character writing are the wings on which this triumphant dragon soars, pulling out all the stops in a whirlwind tour of Northern Thedas and capping it with a terrific finale that’s built on memorably tough choices and consequences. If we never get another Dragon Age, at least it got to go out on a high note.
================================================================================

Game: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review
Verdict: An excellent string of missions that offer variety and flexibility come together to make the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years. Black Ops 6 is a fantastic return to form for the series, allowing the designers at Raven to delve deep into their bag of tricks and keep you guessing at every turn. It successfully makes each chapter distinct from one another, whilst maintaining a strong level of quality across the board. Packing a thoroughly engaging story that gets better the longer it goes on, it exceeds expectations regarding level design and creativity, showing that when given the time to craft them properly, CoD campaigns still have what it takes to be up there with the best first-person shooters.
================================================================================

Game: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed-review
Verdict: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed certainly looks the part, coming admirably close to emulating the scrawled, asymmetrical look of the acclaimed 2023 animated film it functions as a sequel to. It also sounds the part thanks to some genuinely impressive voice acting (although shelling out for some of the ’90s hip hop that gave the movie its own aural edge clearly wasn’t within the budget). However, despite a visible effort to make Mutants Unleashed a lengthy and credible follow-up story to the film, its simple button bashing action quickly becomes boring thanks to its slim selection of enemies and its constantly reused levels. Trying to do too much with too little means it all just becomes rather… vanilla, and that’s a shell of a loaded word to use around the green machine, who rock the town without being seen.
================================================================================

Game: Mass Effect: The Board Game
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review
Verdict: Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz does a good job adapting the personalities and gameplay of Bioware’s legendary space epic while offering some fun twists to the formula to make it work with this new cardboard medium. While it doesn’t land every shot it takes, it lands enough to make it a worthwhile time for fans of the source material and also campaign-style board game aficionados or newcomers alike. The system is sound and ripe for new modules and expansions with new characters and missions. I would love a more dedicated skirmish map or pack that offers a bunch of maps that are good to fight enemies on and forgo the whole narrative aspect. Until then, I will dream about flying around space in the Normandy and rolling dice with my bros, Garrus and Wrex.
================================================================================

Game: Alan Wake
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house-dlc-review
Verdict: The Lake House DLC is another spectacular and spooky slice of Alan Wake II action. It introduces some fantastic new supporting characters to the Remedy Connected Universe, as well as a terrifying new enemy type to overcome and some wonderfully eerie environments to explore. The challenge of its puzzles may be light, but its combat is still chillingly dark even despite the fact it’s not hugely different from that of the main game, and scouring for the many notes, videos, and audio recordings littered throughout its fear-inducing facility made for a genuinely gripping investigation. Funny, frightening, and full of surprises, The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II.
================================================================================

Game: Kong: Survivor Instinct
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/kong-survivor-instinct-review
Verdict: Setting a Metroidvania-style platforming adventure against a backdrop of building-razing beasts is certainly an intriguing idea, but unlike its towering cast of kaiju cameos, Kong: Survivor Instinct itself simply doesn’t measure up. Its story and characters are underwritten, its ravaged urban playground is eye-catching but not particularly surprising to explore, and its combat fails to evolve enough to keep the fights interesting over the course of the journey. The occasional room-rocking escape sequences do literally shake things up, but they’re few and far between and only distract from the otherwise uncomplicated platforming for short bursts at a time. Kong and his kind may hail from an alternate world hidden deep inside the Earth’s core, but the actual gameplay of Kong: Survivor Instinct is strictly one-dimensional.
================================================================================

Game: A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review
Verdict: A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead does a commendable job of taking the uniquely silent scary movie series and spinning it into an interactive adventure, even if its methods for sustaining stress seem a bit too clearly contrived at times. I greatly appreciated the many handcrafted human touches that made its evacuated spaces so evocative, and the safety net of its consistent auto-save meant that my numerous instant deaths never became a source of frustration. However, although it may maintain a regularly tense atmosphere every shuffled step of the way, the absence of any significant story surprises or enough substantial changes to its simplistic stealth-based gameplay means that A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn’t quite have enough twists and turns to make for an unmissable journey.
================================================================================

Game: Sonic X Shadow Generations

Verdict: Sonic X Shadow Generations takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights at a blistering pace by doubling up the campaign length with creative level design, fantastic bosses, plenty of collectibles, and an appreciable graphical upgrade. While the brand-new Shadow content isn't necessarily long on its own, it adds a nice change of pace to the collection of all-time great Sonic stages Generations already contained, and there’s an exciting new story that’s filled in as you explore the overworld for collectibles, activities, and challenges. This bulked-up remaster soars far and above previous enhanced versions we've gotten in the Sonic franchise, and hopefully will be the gold standard Sega holds itself to when it decides to bring back other Sonic games from the past.

Game: Starship Troopers: Extermination
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/starship-troopers-extermination-full-launch-review
Verdict: In the Space Imperialist vs Alien war for your attention, Starship Troopers: Extermination brings a knife to a nuke fight. It’s a shooter you and some friends can find fun in, especially in its tough Horde mode using its simple-yet-distinct classes that help focus the overall large-scale bug-blasting vision. But you’re doing so in spite of how long it takes to unlock all the more interesting gear and abilities those classes have in store, how uncoordinated some of the multiplayer modes are, how downright bad the single-player campaign is, how barren the handful of available maps feel, and the lack of biodiversity in the bug swarm. It’s a serviceable battle that can get frantic in the thick of it, but there are far more noble causes to give your virtual lives for in 2024 than this.
================================================================================

Game: Unknown 9: Awakening
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/unknown-9-awakening-review
Verdict: Unknown 9: Awakening is the kind of routine action-adventure game that probably wouldn't blow me away even if it was executed well – and the fact that it isn’t just makes the whole thing fall completely flat. Everything from the formulaic story to the shallow and dull combat and stealth are well below the standard set by genre peers, and the consistently disheveled performance and bugs don’t do Awakening any favors. There’s at least some fun to be had in its interesting reality-bending powers, especially the mind-controlling abilities that let you briefly play as your foes and sabotage the enemy in clever ways, but these bright spots run their course quickly, leaving us with a wholly underwhelming adventure.
================================================================================

Game: MechWarrior 5: Clans
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mechwarrior-5-clans-review
Verdict: MechWarrior 5: Clans surprised me with its excellent campaign, carried by a thoughtful, well-told story, great mission design, fantastic walking-tank combat, and all of the customization you could want. I genuinely loved playing Clans, especially in co-op, and several story moments and missions will stick with me for a long, long time because of the way they simultaneously made me consider the ethical questions of war while grouping my rockets and lasers to obliterate a target and turning my damaged armor out of harm’s way. I just wish my first playthrough hadn’t been so buggy, especially in co-op. If Piranha’s promised post-launch patches can fix its issues, Clans will have a lot fewer frustrating lows to drag down its many impressive highs – but one way or another, I’ll definitely be suiting up for the Smoke Jaguar Clan for another run in the future.
================================================================================

Game: Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review
Verdict: Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a final flash from the past, sometimes to a fault, as demonstrated by its archaic menus and remedial training tools. Its Episode Battles have the kind of reaction-heavy difficulty that doesn’t really exist in most games these days, more than once crossing the line between challenging and frustrating. But the feeling of traveling back to a simpler time when games didn’t have to be balanced or competitive to be fun is a good one, especially when that action stays so true to that of the show it’s recreating. Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them.
================================================================================

Game: Until Dawn
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-2024-review
Verdict: This remade version of Until Dawn features a substantial visual upgrade that bring it in line with some of the best-looking horror adventures on the PlayStation 5, and Supermassive’s definitive horror story is just as gory and schlocky as it’s ever been. However, its cinematic flair is slightly undermined by the new over-the-shoulder camera, and it suffers at the hands of a frame rate that’s choppier than even the most caffeinated of axe murderers. Movement is noticeably slower and more sluggish than it used to be, and the handful of new gameplay features – like the pointless totem-turning mini-game – are unwelcome and don’t even come close to justifying this remake’s premium price tag especially when the original is sitting right there next to it in the store. Never mind the eight potential victims to be found inside its cabin in the woods, if you’re still determined to play this half-hearted horror remake you should at least wait until it’s the price that is slashed instead.
================================================================================

Game: Metaphor: ReFantazio
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review
Verdict: There’s a certain familiarity in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but Atlus takes the principles of its already excellent RPGs and refines them in a way that effortlessly ushers you through its brutal, and sometimes beautiful, new fantasy world. The Archetype system and all the new wrinkles it added to the turn-based battles build upon a strong foundation, and the social elements are streamlined to better deliver the most important aspects of the stories they tell. The sense of adventure you get from traveling across the kingdom and the powerful sense of purpose you have to do so drive its memorable journey, distinguishing itself from those that came before it. When I finally closed the book on Metaphor after 80 hours, I felt a unique warmth in its message, because it’s driven by the ideals of a just society smartly contextualized in a unique metanarrative. Metaphor: ReFantazio is poetic, and at times, idealistic, but it also understands its complexities and that change requires action, and that even far-fetched fantasy stories can serve as inspiration to make our world a better place.
================================================================================

Game: Undisputed
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-review
Verdict: Developer Steel City Interactive's approach to boxing in Undisputed is on the right track, but there’s a long road ahead of it. Its emphasis on realism, preparing for fights using RPG-like mechanics, and creating an adrenaline-filled experience in the ring are significant building blocks. Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO. Still, it serves as a decent meal for an otherwise-starved genre, and that’s a lot better than we’ve had in the last decade.
================================================================================

Game: Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review
Verdict: Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred is an awesome expansion that adds an excellent new area to explore, a gloriously modular character class that I can’t stop playing, an impressive debut raid activity, and lots more. But while just about everything it adds is awesome, it definitely doesn’t do enough where the somewhat flaccid campaign and story is concerned, and numerous bugs can occasionally drag it down. Thankfully, the changes to the meta, a greatly improved progression system, the resurrection of rune words, and NPC companions are all major wins for Diablo 4, even when it seems we’ll be waiting a bit to see where this interlude expansion leads.
================================================================================

Game: SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/spongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-game-review
Verdict: SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game is obviously geared more towards kids than those of us who grew up loving SpongeBob, but so are things like Astro Bot and Super Mario Wonder, and those games are brilliant. By contrast, the lack of exciting puzzle solutions or meaningful challenges offered across this six-hour adventure is bad enough that it feels like an underestimation of that audience. Propped up by the iconic and playful world of Bikini Bottom, it makes a strong first impression that quickly wears thin. Its physics-heavy sandbox can briefly be a joy to explore if you’re a fan of the TV series, however the slew of monotonous minigames and host of on-loop conversations within it fail to fully capture that show's spirit. Without an engaging goal or overarching story to latch onto, the end result is a repetitive and uninventive adventure that does a disservice to Patrick’s protagonist potential.
================================================================================

Game: Silent Hill 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review
Verdict: Silent Hill 2 is a welcome modernisation of a survival horror masterpiece. It smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game’s combat while taking a piece of heavy grit sandpaper to scuff up every rust and mold-covered surface of its nightmarish environments, successfully making them appear far more abrasive and menacing to explore. Previously primitive boss battles have been transformed into substantially more intense encounters, and its intimidating audio design kept me acutely aware that every fog-cloaked street I walked down could quickly hurry me towards my own dead end. It does feel a little padded out in parts, and I do wish that Bloober Team had streamlined some of its more convoluted puzzle sections to prevent the story’s momentum from sagging on occasion. Still, intermittent pacing problems aside, Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.
================================================================================

Game: Starfield: Shattered Space
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review
Verdict: Starfield: Shattered Space fills the conspicuous Va’ruun-shaped hole in the main campaign with a generous helping of quest content that’s thick with snake-worshiping lore and tough, teleporting enemies. Elder Scrolls and Fallout fans will recognize a lot of these story outlines, but the Starfield twist makes them more than simple reheats. Refreshingly, the new planet is more of a traditional Bethesda-style open world that feels more like a real place where there’s a lot to do, which is a welcome improvement over hopping between mostly barren worlds. However, there’s not much to take with you once you leave, since outside of new quests and a handful of new weapons and building options there are no new gameplay systems – or even new powers or skills – you’ll want to try out after a new run through the Unity. It’s more Starfield for those who want it, but Shattered Space doesn’t shatter a lot of conventions.
================================================================================

Game: Ara: History Untold
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/ara-history-untold-review
Verdict: While Ara: History Untold is a visually captivating historical 4X with an interesting underlying economy, it gets bogged down well before the midway point, mainly because it doesn’t provide enough tools and UI support to manage all of the things it expects you to manage. Your choice of leader, religion, and government almost always simply add uninteresting passive modifiers, which means most playthroughs will feel roughly the same other than the layout of the map itself. I had a pretty decent time with my march through the ages, especially in the first of its three acts. But it did require me to eventually give up on trying to play optimally, passing turns without doing anything until I emerged victorious. A lot of these systems are exciting and clever in their design – they're just not that enjoyable to interact with past a certain point.
================================================================================

Game: Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review
Verdict: Above all, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster preserves the iconic original’s experience while including some very logical and welcome modern adjustments, like auto-saving, a new navigation system, and NPCs that seem less inclined to serve themselves for lunch. Not all the new voice acting is an improvement – and there are a variety of other tedious flaws that have gone unfixed – but wading back into the Willamette Parkview Mall after all these years has been an effective reminder of just how brilliant the original Dead Rising was back in 2006. Coaxing as many hapless consumers as I can back through throngs of the festering undead is as compulsive as it was nearly two decades ago. At the very least, now that I’ve paused to actually package this review together, it’s still gnawing at me to return – and that’s the sign of any great game (or reasonably effective zombie, for that matter).
================================================================================

Game: Tiny Glade
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-glade-review
Verdict: Good things come in small packages, and Tiny Glade is no exception. The gameplay might be limited – or even nonexistent, depending on your definition – but treat it as a toy set and the time you lose to creating villages full of duck ponds and flower gardens won't be. It could certainly use more content and flexibility to dive deeper into, but the way you can quickly and easily create a natural-looking structure using its satisfying procedural building tools got more out of what it has than I expected. Learn to live with the lack of actual objectives, enemies, or natural disasters, and you'll be rewarded with a flow state that borders on a trance and a set of screenshots that will make you huge on #cottagecore TikTok.
================================================================================

Game: Satisfactory
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review
Verdict: Satisfactory is the best automation game ever made and I seriously can’t recommend it enough. Every moment of the over 130 hours it took to build messy conveyor belt disasters and delightfully efficient factories was engaging, ridiculous, and an absolute blast with friends. Exploring this gorgeous, bespoke world in search of secrets and resources serves as a fantastic change of pace from constructing assembly lines, even when combat doesn’t offer much more than a few generic aliens to shoot at while doing so. It’s a drag thatSatisfactory’s insatiable appetite for electronics also results in regular technical annoyances, but none of them come close to souring this stellar factory builder.
================================================================================

Game: Frostpunk 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-review
Verdict: Building up multiple colonies, researching technologies, and passing laws in Frostpunk 2 is quite the act of plate-spinning. Just about anything you do is bound to make one of your city’s factions angry at you, and a powerful storm can literally and figuratively freeze your whole economy. This is a city-building sequel that might have lost some of the intimacy of the original by thinking bigger, but what it’s gained through its ambitious philosophy of reinvention rather than iteration means you can play it immediately after the original and not feel like you’ve done most of this before.
================================================================================

Game: The Plucky Squire
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-plucky-squire-review
Verdict: At its heights, The Plucky Squire is a beautiful Zelda-inspired adventure filled with brilliant wordplay-packed puzzles. Jot’s ability to manipulate his own storybook from both the outside and within result in clever dimension-hopping mechanics and solutions that make each problem a joy to unpack. While genuinely funny at times, its wordy script often gets in the way of the action and occasionally spoils a puzzle’s solution before it even begins. It also drags in its drawn-out final act, as the adventure continues a couple hours after it’s already used up all its best ideas. But prior to that late stumble, The Plucky Squire is full of surprises, breaking up its puzzles with cute minigame homages to classic video game genres and fun sections that take Jot outside of the pages of his story.
================================================================================

Game: Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-review
Verdict: When you’re flying around the pitch, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions can be a blast. Each position has a lot of depth to it, whether you’re harassing the other team’s Seeker as a Beater, drifting to keep up with the Snitch as a Seeker, faking out a Keeper to score as a Chaser, or making the perfect save yourself. Quidditch Champions makes smart rule changes to make this fantasy sport more fun while capturing the look and feel of the Wizarding World. There just isn’t much here off the pitch to keep you playing long-term, and co-op progression issues mean you can’t easily take on its career mode tournaments or grow your collection of unlockables with friends. Quidditch Champions did the near-impossible by turning quidditch into an actual competitive game, but I just wish there was a little more bristle on the end of this broom.
================================================================================

Game: Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review
Verdict: Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is far and away the most ambitious driving game that developer KT Racing has ever put together, but it’s plagued with problems. Forced online requirements that feel needlessly punitive towards solo players, inconsistent and non-adjustable AI difficulty levels, a stale car list, and chore-like progression all conspire to undermine an otherwise robust driving model and eye-catching open world. The former home of the WRC series has come out swinging with Solar Crown, but unfortunately the studio may have flown a little too close to the sun.
================================================================================

Game: Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-dlc-review
Verdict: Episode Aigis: The Answer may not be the most exciting gameplay experience to come from an Atlus RPG, but its story is a crucial piece to Persona 3’s full picture. In its strongest moments, The Answer finds new ways to be just as powerful by understanding the pain that comes from heartbreak and loss in all its complexities, and how that changes a person. With its premise, it expresses the tedium of feeling stuck reliving the same day over and over again, but it’s also a moving statement about how we break out of grief’s vicious cycle and push forward. I always found The Answer to be thematically affecting, and having it repackaged for Reload means it’s no longer isolated as a dated PS2 game – and if anything, it’s a bittersweet epilogue to the series’ best story.
================================================================================

Game: World of Warcraft: The War Within
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review
Verdict: The War Within is the best World of Warcraft has been on all fronts in many years, and possibly ever. When returning franchise creative director Chris Metzen got on stage at BlizzCon and said it was time to come home, he really wasn't just stringing us along. The writing is strong. The gameplay is strong. The music and zone design are exceptional even by Blizzard standards. The endgame loop feels good and offers tons of satisfying ways to progress, including more appropriately difficult and rewarding solo content than ever. The level 80 experience has some wonky tuning and annoying bugs, but I trust Blizzard to get that ironed out in due time. Somehow, this two-decade-old MMO feels fresh and thrilling again.
================================================================================

Game: Funko Fusion
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-review
Verdict: Funko Fusion has no shortage of oversized heads, but between them all it still manages to contain precious little in the way of interesting new ideas. Its simplistic shooting is dull, its many bugs and backtracking requirements are exhausting, and its peculiar marriage of child-pleasing character styles and LEGO-like level design with a number of film and television licenses that are distinctly adult just seems ill-advised from the jump. Although it definitely nails the signature look of the pint-sized collectibles, it’s just not much fun to play which means that just like your Funko Pop collection it’s probably best left on the shelf.
================================================================================

Game: Enotria: The Last Song
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/enotria-the-last-song-review
Verdict: Aside from the fundamentals of combat, Enotria: The Last Song really tries to step outside of the box when it comes to dressing up the standard soulslike. The sun-drenched environments and wild, Italian folklore-inspired character designs are a real breath of fresh air straight from Italy’s Alps. Combat is fun, even when the difficulty spikes unexpectedly (since most of those fights are optional anyway) and despite the bloat of many, many systems that govern all of the more nuanced abilities and stats. The unapproachability of its RPG systems, and the wonky performance when a smooth frame rate matters the most are what really prevent Enotria from taking center stage.
================================================================================

Game: Fortnite Re
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-review-2024
Verdict: No matter which version of Fortnite’s battle royale shooter you prefer, Epic Games makes sure that there’s always something on the horizon waiting for you, both in or out of a match. Whether it’s the enticing glow and heavenly hum of a treasure chest full of loot, the faraway glint of an opponent’s sniper scope on a ridge, a sports car in your favorite color, or an exciting quest to complete, you’d have to try to get bored while playing. And by throwing everything it has at you in updates, chapter after chapter and season after season, Epic’s dedication and support have made Fortnite one of the best-maintained ongoing multiplayer games out there. Even when a new weapon, vehicle, location, or event occasionally feels like a dud, there’s usually something great around the corner to even it out. It’s rare to see a game on this scale constantly experiment, take risks, and have so much fun with itself. And while its goofy, over-the-top crossovers with beloved games, movies, TV shows, and more often bring a whiff of corporate synergy with them, it’s undeniably cool to squad up with friends as your favorite characters and compete for that sweet Victory Royale.
================================================================================

Game: I Am Your Beast
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-your-beast-review
Verdict: I Am Your Beast is a stirring, snack-sized shoot ‘em up that succeeds in spite of its simplified story and slightly punitive progression. Its supremely responsive controls and readily available arsenal of pick-up-and-slay weapons made me feel like a one-man army unleashed on groups of unsuspecting enemies, while its strict time-based goals and bonus objectives gave me reason to return to most of its levels to continually refine my approach. It may lack a truly unique hook to put it head and shoulders above the pack, but I Am Your Beast was still furious enough to sink its claws into me and keep me gripped to it throughout its short stay.
================================================================================

Game: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review
Verdict: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in post-launch updates as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied.
================================================================================

Game: The Casting of Frank Stone
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review
Verdict: The Casting of Frank Stone’s repetitive, time-hopping horror tale is packed with dozens of character choices to consider, but really the most important decision that Dead by Daylight fans need to make is whether or not a sub-standard, six-hour story is worth sitting through purely to spot the odd recognisable weapon or slight reference to the source material’s lore. I would argue it’s not, since no single stretch of this sluggish and forgettable horror show ever comes close to matching the frantic amounts of fun to be had in a single, 15-minute Dead by Daylight trial. Unable to match the intensity of its murderous multiplayer inspiration and lagging well behind Until Dawn and The Quarry as a standalone story, The Casting of Frank Stone is a second-rate interactive slasher that just can’t hack it.
================================================================================

Game: Squirrel with a Gun
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/squirrel-with-a-gun-review
Verdict: Squirrel with a Gun is an awesome, immediately charming idea with legs as short as its fluffy protagonist. While platforming around by firing off weapons and causing mayhem in the small sandbox areas yields plenty of enjoyable moments, shallow combat, numerous technical issues, and short runtime left me wanting more. Even the over-the-top boss fights, which are definitely a high point in the zany adventure, come to an end all too quickly and are in short supply. I still adore this violent rodent and have high hopes for a sequel that’s bigger, more fleshed out, and less prone to crashing, but this first shot leaves a fair bit to be desired.
================================================================================

Game: Concord
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review
Verdict: Concord isn’t the most innovative or content-heavy hero shooter you could play, but with such fantastic competitive gameplay, 16 compelling characters to master, and 12 well-designed maps, it’s got the makings of something that could go the distance in the months and years to come. In fact, it’s a testament to its FPS chops that even while it has a virtually nonexistent story and a serious need for a signature game mode, I still found myself losing dozens of hours to its PvP charms. Hopefully the live-service roadmap will do its thing and show this promising shooter the love it needs to become something truly special, but right now it’s at least good enough for me to recommend trying out.
================================================================================

Game: Visions of Mana
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-review
Verdict: Visions of Mana finally brings the long-dormant classic RPG series into the modern age, looking great and playing even better thanks to multi-layered class and skill systems that interact in clever ways. There are definitely some pacing issues and a few questionable design choices later on, and the occasional framerate drop or awkward lipsyncing can distract. But the flashy and exciting combat, deeply rewarding class system, and cast of likable characters make Visions of Mana a winning comeback for the classic series all the same – and a great game even if you haven’t spent decades waiting for it.
================================================================================

Game: Monster Jam Showdown
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review
Verdict: Monster Jam Showdown distinguishes itself from the last two decades of officially licensed Monster Jam games by actually delivering a decent, if modest, serving of monster truck mayhem. It’s a great looking, family-friendly racer that feels good to fling over giant jumps, but it’s light on track variety and crying out for a deeper career mode and customisation.
================================================================================

Game: Star Wars Outlaws
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review
Verdict: It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures. Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace. A clever syndicate system brings real weight to almost every task you choose to undertake, some of which have creative quest designs that can often conjure up some genuinely stunning blindsides. Having a pal like Nix at your side the entire time not only adds an extra dimension to Kay’s fairly generic smuggler character, but also gives her an enhanced set of useful abilities. But even he can’t quite make its stealth and combat feel any less rigid and repetitive, and the odds of avoiding the many glaring technical issues present at launch are 3,720 to one. But you probably didn’t want me to tell you the odds.
================================================================================

Game: Tactical Breach Wizards
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tactical-breach-wizards-review
Verdict: Tactical Breach Wizards doesn’t demand knowledge from lost magical tomes to conquer its character-focused missions, each of which is filled with lots of doodads to fiddle with and not a lot of space to do it in. Being easy doesn’t mean it isn’t fun though – in fact, the very opposite is true here, thanks to the creative kits on every unit and how dynamic the combinations between them can be. Wrap that up in a vibrant and weird world with some truly incredible writing and it’s hard not to get entranced in its spell.
================================================================================

Game: Fallout London
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-review-mod
Verdict: When you consider it’s a completely free mod rather than an official game, Fallout London is extremely impressive. It’s a massive RPG worthy of the Fallout moniker, and the way it uses its titular city to shake up the series’ US-centric formula is extremely effective and refreshingly novel. The twists and turns of the main story are compelling, aside from when you’re sent off on unrelated busywork, and going off the beaten path to adventure with companions is as fun here as it is in any modern open-world Bethesda game. However, installing this mod is a technical undertaking you need to be prepared for, and even when you’re successful it comes with more than its fair share of bugs and crashes. But of course, it’s all worth it: If you have the mettle to overcome those challenges – and the occasional obtuse mission design – there is a lot of fun to be had in Ol’ Blighty.
================================================================================

Game: Black Myth: Wukong
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc
Verdict: As GameScience’s debut action game, Black Myth: Wukong is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making Black Myth: Wukong a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs.
================================================================================

Game: Madden
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review
Verdict: There’s a lot to like in Madden NFL 25. The on-field action is the best it's been and BOOM Tech and the additions from College Football 25 make it a better game than Madden NFL 24. The presentation upgrades are very welcome too, but the modes are functionally the same. Ultimate Team is still a Skinner Box, Superstar is still mediocre, and the Skills Trainer, while great, really needs an update to help newer and lapsed players along. Franchise is the best thing here, and it still needs help. The improvements it did get are nice, but also long overdue, and you don’t get a parade for doing things you should have done years ago. EA seems content to continue skating by on being the only company with the NFL license. Remember that bit about the definition of insanity?
================================================================================

Game: Dustborn
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dustborn-review
Verdict: After the first hour, I was sure finishing Dustborn would be up there with folding laundry in terms of chores – but just a few hours later and I was invested in the welfare of all my little freaky friends as they played gigs, fought robots, and had sometimes melodramatic conversations. Its band of well-intentioned weirdos tells an absorbing story in an alternate-history America, and while I may have started by rolling my eyes, I was high on science fiction satisfaction and wondering if I was too old to get a neck tattoo and some neon accessories by the end.

Game: Stormgate Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/stormgate-review-early-access
Verdict: As a competitive RTS, Stormgate is what's next. Or at least, I hope it is. It pushes that classic basecraft formula forward with a veteran's eye for what works and what doesn't, and gets me pumped to queue up again right after I finish a match – win or lose – in a way I haven't been since the early days of Wings of Liberty. If I were judging it only based on that, it would get high marks already. But the short, low-rent campaign is less than inspiring, leaving one of its major factions entirely without context and retreading very familiar narrative ground. However, it's rounded out with an exciting co-op mode that features some cool heroes and offers a nice entry point to anyone who doesn't want to leap straight into the jaws of 1v1 matchmaking. For Early Access, Stormgate is pretty promising when it lays all its cards on the table. But it still has miles to go.
================================================================================

Game: Volgarr the Viking 2
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/volgarr-the-viking-2-review
Verdict: Volgarr the Viking 2 is not a bad game, but it is one that feels at odds with itself. It’s built on a foundation of encouraging you to master the very precise and careful spacing in both its combat and platforming, which starts out quite compelling… but once you use six continues, you’re locked into a mode that throws all of the precision out the window as you become impervious to all damage. And even if it didn’t eventually trivialize itself with the Zombie Volgarr mode, the levels themselves are too long to be suited for that kind of incremental mastery unless you have the patience of a saint or the skill of a speedrunner. Even as someone who generally loves hard-as-nails games, Volgarr the Viking 2 disappointingly crosses the line from satisfying challenge to unfair frustration too often to recommend it.
================================================================================

Game: SteamWorld Heist 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/steamworld-heist-2-review
Verdict: SteamWorld Heist 2’s charming adventure refines the original game’s clever turn-based combat with a flexible mix-and-match class system and handmade maps that are built around using teamwork to accomplish their objectives and escape unscathed. On top of that, it serves up a light and entertaining real-time nautical exploration game as a palette cleanser between battles, and swapping between them helps things stay fresh for more than twice the first game’s 15-hour length. It’s occasionally mired in grinding to unlock the next area and the skill system will make you waste a lot of XP if you don’t know what’s coming, but there’s no shortage of loot, amusingly off-kilter robot characters, and fantastic original folksy music along the way.
================================================================================

Game: The Sims 4 Re
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024
Verdict: The Sims 4 is starting to feel its age in 2024, but what keeps it so compelling is that magical feeling that occurs when all its parts work together to create the rich tapestry of your Sims' lives. The complex character creator and approachable building mode are both impressive in their own right – and as personality quirks rub up against the houses you’ve tenderly built, you’re rewarded with hilarious and profound emotional reactions from the beloved families you’re guiding. Romance, friendship, and hatred all play essential roles, and there’s a deeper focus on replicating the complexities of human life than any other game in this genre. Yet despite maintaining the bar for life simulators at large, the last decade has also left the base game with an outdated fashion sense and locked what now feel like core features such as pets behind paid DLC – a problem that can only be escaped by indulging in fan-made mods or costly expansions. Even so, after hundreds of hours of playtime and nearly a decade of history, I’m still always excited to build a new family dynamic and start the chaotic cycle of life all over again.
================================================================================

Game: Earth Defense Force 6
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/earth-defense-force-6-review
Verdict: Earth Defense Force 6 is yet another riotous entry in one of the most ridiculous and corny series ever to make very poor use of our fancy gaming hardware. It looks at least a decade out of date, is absolutely dripping with plot holes and awful voice acting, and has some of the silliest combat I’ve seen in a long time – but all of that only works to its credit, coming together as a game I’ve happily lost dozens of hours of my life to while giggling like an idiot. Not all of its rough edges add to its charm, though, and an overly long campaign filled with repetitive levels and some irritating design choices definitely work against it. But those things are pretty easy to forgive when you accidentally blow your friends up with a rocket launcher that sends giant ants sailing into the air and skyscrapers crumbling into rubble.
================================================================================

Game: Nobody Wants to Die
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-review
Verdict: Nobody Wants to Die’s relatively brief story isn’t a completely original concept, but it has a cool mix of inspirations and unique worldbuilding touches that all work well together to create something new and engaging. There’s a bit too much hand-holding for a game about the art of investigation, but its conversation system picks up the slack with humor, unexpected outcomes, and a surprisingly deep story about how impactful your past can be on your present — even when you’re facing immortality.
================================================================================

Game: F1 Manager 2024
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-manager-2024-review
Verdict: F1 Manager 2024 doesn't completely escape the pitfalls that come with being an annual series, though evolutionary changes make this a welcome third outing. New features like creating your own team offer strong customization options, and securing victories with a tailor-made squad feels even sweeter than building upon an existing one. The mechanical faults and expanded sponsorship systems add welcome strategic depth, too. Several flaws like the tedious contracts system and sprint format, could use further work, and some lingering issues like collision damage haven’t been solved, but this is still Frontier's best take on a Formula 1 management sim yet.
================================================================================

Game: Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review
Verdict: While the early hours are a bit rough, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is one of those soulslikes that only gets better as you get further in, unlocking more of the interesting skills that allow you to fully take advantage of its attack chains and XP multipliers. However, you’ll need to want to head off the beaten path to tackle sidequests, find optional fights, or interact with various NPCs to earn weapons and upgrades in order to get the most out of it. Thankfully, Flintlock respects your time while doing so with its use of shortcuts, fast travel, and other ways of making exploring fun and easy. It may have an abridged run time compared to other RPGs, but it makes good use of that time with interesting sidequests and an excellent minigame. Unfortunately, Flintlock’s story meanders a bit towards the middle and wastes a few opportunities that could have let its main characters shine, but this adventure did leave me interested to find out where Nor and Enki will go next.
================================================================================

Game: Once Human
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/once-human-review
Verdict: Once Human is a lot of fun, with survival-crafting that is simple and accessible, but still rewarding to dig into. Building a house is amusing, even if pieces aren’t always cooperative about snapping together in the right orientation. And while the combat is generally pretty basic, the grotesque weirdness of the monsters more than makes up for that, especially when you get a menagerie of weird little creatures of your own to fight with. Once Human would benefit from more creative quests and a flatter difficulty curve, but I still had a great time, and I’m eager to continue my adventures in this twisted world as its first season progresses.
================================================================================

Game: Kunitsu
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review
Verdict: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is an exciting action-strategy hybrid that left me yearning to know more about its inspirations and intricacies. The satisfying day-night structure of its stages evoked that overwhelming “just one more thing” feeling that easily had me losing track of time – and while it could occasionally be tainted by busy work base management deeper in, the overall experience was a delightfully unique one. It’s not the most challenging action game around, but the strategy it demands is still satisfying, and its wide range of interesting enemy designs and quiet but effective storytelling are something I’ll remember for a long while. It’s an odd thought, but I’m glad a game as enigmatic as Kunitsu-Gami exists.

Game: The First Descendant
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review
Verdict: The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way. In its best moments, blasting aliens apart with both fireballs and a satisfying arsenal of weapons makes for a really great time – but at least an equal portion of my time was spent battling perplexing design decisions that tested the limits of my abundant patience. Like its peers, future updates could evolve this live-service into a much more consistently enjoyable way to spend time with friends, but for now it misses the mark too often to make its grind feel worthwhile.

Game: Lorelei and the Laser Eyes
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review
Verdict: Exploring Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ forlorn manor feels both familiar and novel. Shoving playing cards and letters and other objects into my pockets in the hopes that they’ll help me decode a lock or solve some mystery down the line would fit right at home with the best of the classic point-and-click adventure game genre, but the lovely, low-fi presentation, eerie story, and creative puzzles wrapped around that are all impressively fresh. An unwavering dedication to being a one-button game adds some unnecessary annoyances, but it doesn’t stop it from being a captivating journey just the same. Like all the best puzzle games, it had me frantically scribbling symbols, numbers, and names on physical pieces of paper just to make sure I left no otherworldly stone unturned.
================================================================================

Game: Bodycam Early Access
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/bodycam-early-access-review
Verdict: Bodycam is a mostly competent multiplayer shooter and what you can see through the limited field of view of the titular bodycam looks great, but the narrow perspective manages to strike an unfortunate imbalance of being both in the way of good action and immersion-breaking. When all the elements align, like during tense games of Team Deathmatch on some strong maps, it can feel grounded and rewarding to wrestle the kickback of its punchy weapons and score a few one-shot kills before the enemy can line up their own shot, but too much of the time it feels in need of major reworks and rebalancing – especially the terrible respawn system in Deathmatch and when you get killed because you got caught on a tiny obstacle. If there were meaningful progression, like more interesting cosmetics than the paltry ones available or something to chase beyond climbing up a leaderboard then I would be more inclined to stick it out and see how things develop over time. But as it is, Bodycam is an interesting tech demo and little else, so you’ll probably want to wait for it to be fleshed out before jumping in.
================================================================================

Game: The Rogue Prince of Persia Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-early-access
Verdict: With a slick presentation and an incredibly fun combat system, all the right pieces are here for The Rogue Prince of Persia’s success. But while running on walls and zooming through enemies are fast-paced joys, the repetition you’ll face and the faint whisper of a story that loosely ties things everything together wear thin far too quickly as of its Early Access launch. It will undoubtedly be fascinating to watch The Rogue Prince of Persia fill out as time goes on, but  both bug fixes and more of pretty much every good thing need to be equal priorities in its upcoming updates to move the needle to something great. Some of that has already arrived, so I’m at least optimistic The Rogue Prince of Persia could have what it takes to one day become the next major roguelite favorite, but it’s pretty far from that goal where it sits now.
================================================================================

Game: Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
Score: 10
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review
Verdict: FromSoftware says Shadow of the Erdtree is the only expansion Elden Ring will get, so it’s fortunate that it’s hard to imagine a better DLC than this – as long as you’re not hoping for it to do anything radically outside the box. Everything I loved about the original has been condensed into an incredibly tight package – one that’s the size of many standalone games all on its own, and can only be considered “small” in comparison to the absolutely massive world of Elden Ring itself. Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played.
================================================================================

Game: Still Wakes the Deep
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-review
Verdict: I want to give Still Wakes the Deep all the credit it deserves for its fantastic art, dialogue, voiceover work, and setting. But it's frustrating to play with its nearly on-rails structure that actively scoffs at the idea of exploration. And as much as I wanted to be freaked out by it, I almost never was, trying as I might to set the mood as best as possible. It's the kind of game where I think watching someone else play through it and playing it yourself would be nearly identical experiences, and that doesn't make it easy for me to recommend.
================================================================================

Game: Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review
Verdict: I was more than happy to revisit Shin Megami Tensei V, one of my favorite games of 2021, through this definitive version. Vengeance doesn't necessarily make drastic improvements per se, but I enjoyed the new twists, content, and quality of life upgrades it does bring all the same. And while the storyline and route exclusive to Vengeance are a bit better than the original, their appeal as a returning player is really just in how they shake things up at certain points. Don’t get it twisted, though – there’s never been a better time to play this hard-nosed RPG, if not for its satisfying turn-based combat, then for its masterful execution of a uniquely demonic world. There’s a certain attitude that comes through vividly in its art style, character design, and music that you just don’t get in other games. So, if you're simply looking for more SMT or have yet to experience Atlus’ devilish RPG series, Vengeance is absolutely worth seeing through.
================================================================================

Game: Destiny 2: The Final Shape
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review
Verdict: Destiny 2’s potential was clear from the first time I blasted my way through The Red War seven years ago, but Bungie never actually realized much of that potential until The Final Shape. This finale expansion’s story largely succeeds at delivering a satisfying ending, the raid is brutal and epic, the Prismatic subclasses breathe fresh life into combat, and the new enemy faction adds some much-needed variety to the things you’ll spend hours shooting in the face. None of that makes Destiny’s avalanche of confusing RPG systems, currencies, and storylines any easier to digest – but for the first time in a long while, I can wholeheartedly recommend pushing through that darkness, because there’s now a bright and beaming light at the end of the tunnel.
================================================================================

Game: Alan Wake
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review
Verdict: Alan Wake II: Night Springs is a compact collection of standalone stories that veer from entertainingly violent shootouts, to tense stretches of survival horror, before settling on and reveling in the utterly batshit craziness that makes Remedy’s multiverse of madness so keenly absorbing to explore. There’s admittedly not much new here from a gameplay perspective, and it feels like a bit of a tease to play as a version of Control’s heroine stripped of her special abilities in the second episode. Even so, the highs I felt during my short return to Alan Wake’s universe greatly outweighed the lows, and I’d gladly play through another collection of bite-sized side stories if Remedy ever decided to bake another batch. Could there be more Night Springs in the future? Hope springs eternal.
================================================================================

Game: Wuthering Waves
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/wuthering-waves-review
Verdict: Wuthering Waves combo-heavy action, mobility, and monster taming enhance combat and exploration enough to respectably distinguish it from competitors. Its combat is polished and sophisticated, rewarding reactivity and pushing me to carefully consider my builds and teams. On top of that, the Echo equipment system ties your character progression into the environment in a way that encourages exploration, which can be satisfying despite the repetitive process of fighting overworld mobs. Unfortunately, the story is a bland, exposition-heavy slog, with dull writing and voice acting that rarely kept me interested. But while the quests may not be what’s pulling me along, I’m still looking forward to checking back in with the next major update to see how Wuthering Waves evolves.
================================================================================

Game: MultiVersus
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-review
Verdict: MultiVersus is an entertaining and deep platform fighter, but everything outside of simply jumping into a 1v1 or 2v2 match as any one of the eclectic characters in its cast (who are only related by a common corporate overlord) is tedious. I’ll keep coming back to experiment with my Iron Giant’s perk build for team play or learn how to use Marvin The Martian to his fullest, but I’d be glued to this game if I was given more opportunities to earn memorable variant skins or challenge my skills in increasingly tough PvE battles. Instead, MultiVersus offers days of grinding to earn the opportunity to grind more to attain its most enticing rewards, whether that’s the chance to play as an upcoming character or to swag out your favorite fighter. While it’s a huge boon that the actual fighting is solid and worth the time to dig into, it’s going to take more fun objectives to complete and more fruitful rewards to make me want to return over and over again.
================================================================================

Game: Disney Dreamlight Valley
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review
Verdict: After more than a year since its original debut, Disney Dreamlight Valley is still pretty great, with cartoonish and colorful areas to explore and loads of charming characters to meet. Hanging out with a growing roster of Disney icons is a remarkably good time, and some of the recent additions, like Gaston, made my return to the valley an even more worthwhile venture. But a lot of the shortcomings from the Early Access days haven’t necessarily improved much either, including its habit of leaving stories on a cliffhanger ending, a monstrous grind that just don’t quit, and bugs that continue to plague an otherwise good time. Still, there’s something undeniably riveting about chilling with the goofy oddballs and loveable toons from Disney’s impressive catalog, and returning to this zen-like simulator washed my troubles away like few cozy games can.
================================================================================

Game: Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-review
Verdict: Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is as silly and entertaining as the movie that spawned it, and that makes for a surprisingly compelling asymmetrical multiplayer game to boot. The back-and-forth between the wacky, murderous Klowns and the whiny teens is a blast no matter which side of the equation you find yourself on, and unlockable classes and abilities add some much needed variety… for a little bit, at least. After a handful of hours, once you’ve tried out all the human and Klown options and learned the layouts of the small number of maps, that competitive loop can get pretty stale. Here’s hoping developer Illfonic has some tricks up their baggy, checkered sleeves and can deliver updates to keep the clown car chugging along beyond that, but for now Killer Klowns makes for at least a dozen hours of really enjoyable hijinks.
================================================================================

Game: xResist
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review
Verdict: When all the pieces fall into place, 1000xResist paints a beautifully messy, often cruel, but brutally honest picture of who we are. It’s an invitation to see a deeply personal and mature reflection of the Asian diaspora, dissecting the immigrant experience to show something much greater than simple representation. It’s profound without ever being pretentious, unapologetically sentimental without excess, and bittersweet in intimate moments without losing sight of its radical politics. While all that is a testament to its impeccable writing, its artistic vision creates a striking sense of place for its characters to become more than just their functions. 1000xResist is a revolution in storytelling, forged by the things that have shaped our lives, and in turn, one that shows us what it takes to shape our future.
================================================================================

Game: F1 24
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review
Verdict: In isolation, F1 24 remains a slick, deep, and marvellous motorsports experience. If you’re a racing gamer who’s just getting into F1 (or an F1 fan who’s just getting into gaming) it’s terrific stuff, packed with options, assists, and various other tweakable toggles to make it hugely approachable to F1 fans of all skill levels. However, if you’re a returning player of F1 23, and F1 22, and so on, it’s hard to deem F1 24 essential. Despite its refurbished career mode and handling overhaul, it’s basically a neck and neck finish with the last few years’ versions. And when you have a head start, that’s kind of a loss.
================================================================================

Game: Capes
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/capes-review
Verdict: Capes’ clever and challenging take on superhero-flavored turn-based tactical combat gives you all of the information you need to turn the tables on its villains. Watching the action figure-like characters combine their powers and supercharge their diverse ultimate abilities sells their teamwork well, and chasing optional objectives in each mission gives you a lot to think about to counter a wide range of enemy types. Stealth missions don’t work quite as well but they’re mostly optional, and the story, heroes, and villains are entertainingly written throughout the substantial campaign.
================================================================================

Game: Senua's Saga: Hellblade
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review
Verdict: Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II delivers a spellbinding adventure packed with cinematic spectacle and story surprises that maintains a surging sense of forward momentum and never wastes a second of its slender run time. Its combat manages to feel consistently intimidating and immediate despite its mechanical simplicity, and its perspective-based puzzles regularly scratch cerebral itches even though they largely rehash or rework concepts from Senua’s previous story. A journey as brutal as it is beautiful delivered with hardware-pushing visuals and persistently absorbing audio, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is another Viking-worthy feast for the senses that meets the high bar set by its predecessor, even if it never really manages to clear it.
================================================================================

Game: Sins of a Solar Empire 2
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review
Verdict: In its current state, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is hard to recommend. On the one hand, it’s clearly not ready for prime time, despite what the Epic Game Store page and post-1.0 version number would have you believe. It’s buggy, makes no effort to teach you how to use its huge number of very complex systems, its menus are weirdly and counter-intuitively arranged, and there isn’t even a server browser. On the other, all of this confusion comes on top of what is a very faithful follow-up to a beloved real-time 4X game from more than a decade ago, and Ironclad has added some cool new ideas to it on top of the under-the-hood and graphical improvements. Sins 2 can be pretty fun with a friend once you figure out how most things work and your massive fleet is blowing some poor guy’s home planet to Kingdom Come, but man, does it take a long time to get there. Maybe when it arrives on Steam with the features we’ve been promised, Ironclad Games will have (ahem) ironed out all these problems and atone for the sin of releasing it prematurely and hoping nobody noticed.
================================================================================

Game: Gray Zone Warfare Early Access
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review
Verdict: Gray Zone Warfare’s early access version has some excellent ideas for a highly realistic take on an extraction shooter, but most of them come with a caveat or two at this point. Yes, the map is huge, lush, and full of enemies to shoot at, but you will need to be prepared to wait far too long for rides to and from objectives. The damage system is realistic and immersive, but it shoots itself in the foot with unreliable hit registration, and playing wounded is a lot less fun. The detailed weapons are painstakingly true to life, with lots of great customization options, but if you don’t already subscribe to Soldier of Fortune magazine it’s going to be tough to make great use of it. The enthusiasm and ambition behind this game is palpable, even if it is currently rough, buggy, and too often unreliable. But like a greasy burger at a roadside dive, its charm isn’t in craftsmanship, it’s in the earnestness. While its flaws are a bit too numerous to list, much less completely overlook, it can hit the spot just right if you have the right sort of hunger.
================================================================================

Game: Homeworld 3 Multiplayer
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/homeworld-3-multiplayer-review
Verdict: Homeworld 3’s multiplayer modes deliver both a safe, traditional skirmish sandbox that we expect from any RTS and also a more novel, three-player co-op mode in War Games. The fact that the two factions are only slightly asymmetrical and the map selection is so slim makes skirmishes feel a little barebones, though as always Homeworld's three-dimensional strategy gameplay offers different opportunities to outthink your opponents in a style of competitive multiplayer battle you won't find elsewhere. Meanwhile, there’s a ton of immediate thrills and long-term potential in War Games thanks to its randomized upgrades that allow co-op partners to specialize their fleets to concentrate on taking down different types of threats and handle anything that might come their way.
================================================================================

Game: Homeworld 3 Single
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/homeworld-3-review-single-player-campaign
Verdict: Homeworld 3’s campaign goes out of its way to change up the style of missions we fight our way through as Imogen S’jet seeks out a missing Hiigaran fleet and faces an unhinged enemy. The resulting battle of wills feels more consequential than the off-screen galactic threat behind it. Relatively close-quarters scenarios have you guiding dozens of ships through eye catching gauntlets of asteroids and enormous space stations, and the dogfights and capital ship slug-fests that play out are a sight to behold. Being able to pause time and give orders makes managing your fleet much less overwhelming, especially given the tricky controls and sometimes disobedient friendly ship AI. Straightforward tech upgrades and a limited selection of ship types limit the campaign’s replayability, but building an armada and watching it tear through the enemy is always a satisfying sci-fi light show.
================================================================================

Game: Fallout 76
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-review-2024
Verdict: Fallout 76 has come a long way since 2018, transforming into something that’s much closer to the original “Fallout with Friends” pitch that was so enticing about it. The combat, exploration, and RPG systems all feel so good that it’s easy to lose dozens of hours running around the massive map getting lost in over-the-top action. That said, this wasteland still has plenty of room to grow, as its added Expeditions are less interesting than I’d hoped for, the endgame is still a bit thin, and the inventory system seems designed to infuriate – or worse, twist your arm into paying for a real-money subscription to ease the pain. Even still, I never thought I’d return to Appalachia after my initially harrowing experience with it, but Bethesda has really put in the wrench time on this one, and I’m so glad I gave it another shot.
================================================================================

Game: Animal Well
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-well-review
Verdict: Animal Well is a veritable feast of brain teasers that’s far more concerned with twisting your mind into knots than any grueling platforming challenges. It’s lovely to look at thanks to gorgeous pixel art and dynamic lighting, and an excellent use of haptics and well-tuned physics systems make it fun to touch, too. Animal Well’s steadily unlocked toybox of tools thoroughly rewards play, curiosity, and experimentation for hours upon hours after the credits roll. Though that late-game maze of mind-teasers might grate once in a while if you’re reluctant to ask for help, the massive onion of Animal Well’s secrets remains dense, clever, and thrilling even when you’ve peeled back as many layers as you think you possibly can… and then peeled a few more beyond that.
================================================================================

Game: Little Kitty, Big City
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/little-kitty-big-city-review
Verdict: Little Kitty, Big City is an undeniably cozy and mechanically minimal game tailor-made for cat lovers. Its small but inviting sandbox can provide a few hours of ticking objectives off a list before any repetition sets in, allowing this feline adventure to stretch its exploratory legs before wearing out its welcome. Its graphics are cute and delightful, especially for people who just like to watch their pets leap into boxes or trot along when they realize they are not supposed to be in the kitchen. What’s missing are a few layers of polish on its movement and camera controls, which can make climbing around this city more frustrating than it needs to be. And while the campaign may be brief, being a street-level cat discovering the world a few blocks at a time easily holds up across it.
================================================================================

Game: Stardew Valley
Score: 10
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024
Verdict: Stardew Valley is not only the best farming game I’ve played, it is one of my favorite games of all time. That myself and others keep returning to this eight-year old gem each time it gets even the smallest update speaks to how it’s truly a masterpiece in the genre it both reinvigorated and has come to define. It is chock-full of bizarre and memorable characters, moments, and conversations, not to mention a neverending to-do list that fuels the completionist in me. It’s also an intensely strategic adventure, using its cozy farming activities and cute pixel art to make the deeply engaging time management challenge underneath it all effortlessly inviting. Stardew Valley has earned a spot on your platform of choice as a modern classic, standing proudly alongside gaming’s all-time greats. I’ve played countless hours already and will surely play countless more, because every time I boot it up, it feels like coming home.
================================================================================

Game: V Rising
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/v-rising-review
Verdict: V Rising has been nicely polished up during its dark slumber in Early Access, allowing it to fully rise to the occasion with its excellent boss design and challenging ARPG combat. Keeping the killing rays of the sun and your dwindling blood supply as ongoing concerns is effective and evocative in selling the vampire fantasy, as is the ability to craft the sprawling, spooky estates of my nightmares. And the huge amount of customization available when setting up your own private server practically eliminates the need to do chores that are timed to real-world days in a way that only really makes sense for playing with a larger clan and having those timers going even when you're not online. Arise, ye children of the night, and sink your teeth into one of the best ARPGs – and one of the best vampire games, in general – of this moonlit age.
================================================================================

Game: Hades 2 Early Access
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-early-access-review
Verdict: Hades 2 feels impossibly huge and unbelievably polished by any standard, much less an early access game. Mel is awesome, the new tweaks to the combat and progression are excellent,  and its just unbelievably feature packed with twice the content of the first. Despite that, it is clearly still a work in progress: There are some placeholder art assets; there are still more weapon aspects to come, there’s a weapon missing from the arsenal of a six, there’s currently no proper story ending, and there’s still another planned region that will be part of the next major update in the next few months. But even with all that it’s currently missing, what’s here right out of the gate is astounding, and the thought of more coming on the way is a tantalizing treat.
================================================================================

Game: Another Crab’s Treasure
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/another-crabs-treasure-review
Verdict: Another Crab’s Treasure is one of my favorite soulslikes in quite some time. It borrows a lot from the usual genre playbook, but adds a colorful, irresistibly charming, and wholly unique veneer that makes it all feel brand spanking new. The story is well-written and filled with memorable moments and characters, the shell-swapping mechanic is unique and adorable as heck, and the unrelentingly cheerful mood is like finding land after years adrift in an angsty sea of Bloodborne imitators. Its combat isn’t the deepest ocean around and it has a bit of jank here and there, but Another Crab’s Treasure is so clever and wonderfully ridiculous that it’s absolutely worth your time.
================================================================================

Game: Sand Land
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/sand-land-review
Verdict: I'm happy to see Sand Land get a second wind with an open-world action game, and it can sometimes adapt the series in impressive ways. But while there is the potential of an interesting expansion of the manga here, it doesn’t manage to replicate what Toriyama's panels were able to illustrate so effectively. Beneath some ho-hum dialogue and stilted cutscenes is a fun story with its heart in the right place, and Beelzebub and friends at least have the charisma to carry you through to the end alongside a quirky set of supporting characters and villains. Dialing in on vehicular combat and exploration pays off to both maintain the spirit of the original work and deliver some high points, but the quests themselves fall into repetition. Thus, Sand Land suffers the same fate we’ve seen in many other game adaptations of anime and manga – competent in several respects with a few moments of brilliance, but for the most part, a simply okay adventure that can only occasionally capture what makes the source material special.
================================================================================

Game: Manor Lords Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-review-early-access
Verdict: Manor Lords is a gorgeous medieval city-builder that kept me occupied for hours building my perfect, cozy hamlets. But it's not the type of Early Access game that seems like all it needs is some spit and polish to be fully playable. No, it's definitely unfinished in several key, critical ways, notably lacking much of an endgame challenge or any way to put its flashy RTS battles to a real test. It's a great foundation, and I see a lot of promise here. But there was only so much fun I was able to squeeze out of such an incomplete demo. I will definitely be keeping my eye on Manor Lords and eagerly awaiting each new update, but I also wouldn't blame you if you decided to hold off on striking the earth for now. That's not a dig at all. I said the exact same thing about Baldur's Gate 3 when it first released into Early Access, and it eventually came full circle to become one of my favorite games of all time. But I have to be realistic about what's here right now – and it’s somewhat less than what would allow me to recommend it wholeheartedly.
================================================================================

Game: TopSpin 2K25
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/topspin-2k25-review
Verdict: TopSpin 2K25’s chunky career mode may occasionally be marred by periods of grind amidst its Grand Slams, its licensed player roster is a little slight compared to its impressive stable of stadiums, and its implementation of virtual currency attributes bafflingly unrealistic values to goods and services as though they were appraised by a kindergartner with no understanding of money. In spite of these drawbacks, though, TopSpin 2K25 is an absolute blast on court, and one that I’m struggling to put down. Claiming this is the best tennis simulation since Top Spin 4 may be a bit of a backhanded compliment since there haven't exactly been any other genuine serve-and-volley contenders released in recent years, but there’s little doubt that despite its rough edges this is still the most enjoyable way to get a realistic rally going in your own home without building an actual court in your backyard.
================================================================================

Game: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-arcade-wrath-of-the-mutants-review
Verdict: How much you enjoy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants will depend on what you’re looking for in a beat ‘em up. If you just want something easy to play so you can laugh along with friends while you’re all splitting a New York pie on your couch, you’ll probably have a good time for the hour and change it takes to burn through it. If you’re looking for something more mechanically nuanced, like TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge or Streets of Rage 4, you’ll probably be hungry for more after the credits roll. What’s here feels good, but I wish there was more of it, and the lack of online co-op is a total bummer, dude. It’s like a two-dollar slice of pizza you pick up while walking home in New York City after a night on the town: it hits the spot in the moment, but it’s not gonna fill you up for long.
================================================================================

Game: No Rest for the Wicked Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-early-access
Verdict: No Rest for the Wicked is a compelling and unique action-RPG that blends a whole bunch of great genre ideas into one promising package, even though its incompleteness can be felt throughout the abridged early access version’s story. With lots of loot and inventory shortcomings, some technical issues, and some isometric camera angles that take getting used to, there’s still plenty to tweak in the months of development to come before 1.0. I, for one, hope the balance of inventory management and grinding health items tips back more in favor of getting you into the action of its skill-based combat. But even in this early state – before co-op multiplayer even arrives – I’ve had an absolute blast with the precise and challenging combat, memorable exploration, and art, voice acting, and characters that make me really eager to see more of the story and further explore the high-risk, high-reward roguelike mode. With so much going for it already, I could easily see this becoming a landmark game for action RPGs, and that potential is exciting.
================================================================================

Game: Tales of Kenzera: Zau
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review
Verdict: The worst thing I can say about Tales of Kenzera: Zau is that it’s platforming and level designs are fun, clearly inspired by some of the best Metroidvanias around, but don’t really produce any moments that rival those inspirations. Its combat, though also simple and familiar, manages to sing thanks to a small but meaningfully offering of different skills and enemies. And that action is ultimately just a satisfying break from the main attraction: a truly moving tale about how to go on in this world when your loved ones have passed on to the next.
================================================================================

Game: Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review
Verdict: One you get past its slow start, Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes mostly succeeds in weaving the stories of multiple countries and characters together into a sprawling epic. Its turn-based combat system operates smoothly, even if other modes like its strategy RPG battles can encourage simplistic strategies over critical thinking. And while collecting and experimenting with its titular hundred heroes can be entertaining, you won’t get to know the majority of them because of how much screen time they need to share with this bloated cast. Still, there’s plenty of satisfying side quests and castle building to fill in the gaps, which makes Hundred Heroes eventually feel worth the journey.
================================================================================

Game: Harold Halibut
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/harold-halibut-review
Verdict: It may take place at the bottom of the ocean on a distant alien planet, but Harold Halibut’s story is an entirely human one, both in terms of its carefully handmade environments and its strong emphasis on empathy towards its eccentric cast of characters. While I wish that there was a little more interactivity to be found throughout its subaquatic setting, and Harold’s shuffling run could have been boosted to a sprint to reduce the time spent repeatedly schlepping from one end of its levels to the other, I nonetheless remained captivated by his whimsical quest to unite his community and explore the spectacular surroundings of his sunken home. Consistently funny and full of surprises, Harold Halibut is a wholesome, handcrafted adventure with plenty of heart.
================================================================================

Game: Broken Roads
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/broken-roads-review
Verdict: Broken Roads is an ambitious RPG that can’t meet the expectations it sets for itself. It asks you to invest in an intricate morality system only to not end up making good use of it, giving you choices that don’t lead to much. A lot of this could be forgiven if the story held up, but there really isn’t much of a story to begin with, despite the philosophical angle Broken Roads tries very hard to get across. Couple this disappointing journey’s interesting but poorly executed ideas with pointless and often busted combat, and Broken Roads lives up to its name in all the wrong ways.
================================================================================

Game: Children of the Sun
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/children-of-the-sun-review
Verdict: Strip essentially everything out of the Sniper Elite series except the bullets – then make the bullets magic and capable of steering, stopping, and speeding up – and you’re maybe four-fifths of the way to understanding what Children of the Sun is. Either way, puzzle-shooter is probably too broad a term to adequately describe it, which makes it a rare commodity. That is, it’s weird, and it’s different, and it’s not really like anything I’ve played before. However, while this slickly-packaged and shrewd supernatural sniping game is packed with satisfying spatial problems to solve (and shoot), once you’ve had success on a map there’s not a great deal to glean from trying it again.
================================================================================

Game: Botany Manor
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/botany-manor-review
Verdict: Clever clues entwine with Botany Manor’s charming old English setting to make a lighthearted first-person puzzler worth tending to. Figuring out how to grow its fantastical plants kept me on my toes, and the blossoming flora painting onto the pages of my herbarium with bright colors gave me a comforting sense of achievement. I was more invested in deciphering its puzzles than I was reading the notes and letters that make up its fairly one-note story, but the variety of surreal seeds with unique traits in each new area gave an exciting cadence to the somewhat repetitive act of tracking down clues. Botany Manor is a laid-back game that doesn’t ask you to do too much, simply grow some strange plants and decompress – and sometimes that’s exactly what you need.
================================================================================

Game: Astra: Knights of Veda
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/astra-knights-of-veda-review
Verdict: Astra: Knights of Veda’s intriguing mystery and engaging combat had me wishing I could enjoy it more than I did, but its sluggish progression and unintuitive user experience made this RPG feel like it was fighting against me. The beginner rewards are reasonable enough that it's fairly safe to check out as a free-to-play game, but be warned that the best of its story doesn’t come around until at least the halfway point of the campaign. Anyone taking on this adventure will need the patience to learn the layers of systems, grind to high enough levels to survive its hardest enemies, and come back even after your game inevitably crashes. It’s a tough ask, but one that’s worth at least looking into if you’re interested in a darker take on an anime fantasy RPG.
================================================================================

Game: Pepper Grinder
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/pepper-grinder-review
Verdict: Like its diminutive main character, Pepper Grinder may be a little on the short side, but even this small pinch of Pepper still packs plenty of punch. Plowing through platforms feels fantastic, no two levels ever seem the same, and there are some wonderfully destructive toys to discover and employ along the way. I do wish the boss fights outside of the final encounter were a bit more challenging, and the lack of anything meaningful to buy in the in-game store meant I didn’t feel compelled to take too many return trips through each world to collect any missed currency and extend my playtime. But if you’re in the mood for a short but sweet slice of propulsive platforming action of a kind rarely seen since Ecco the Dolphin’s last adventure, Pepper Grinder is all driller and no filler.
================================================================================

Game: Open Roads
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/open-roads-review
Verdict: Propelled by a star-studded cast and charming retro world, Open Roads' tale of family tragedy stumbles over its heavier themes, delivering an earnest but ultimately safe road trip mystery. Pottering through meticulous environments full of kitschy decor was at least enough to keep me entertained for its short runtime. However, with sharp teeth and no bite, I was left hungry for something meatier and more emotionally charged by the time the credits rolled.
================================================================================

Game: Outpost: Infinity Siege
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/outpost-infinity-siege-review
Verdict: Outpost: Infinity Siege takes some pretty big swings with its mishmash of ideas, and succeeds at a surprising number of them – whether it's the insanely dense RPG mechanics, its tight FPS gunfights, or its open-ended base-building options. It certainly doesn’t stick the landing everywhere, with a dreadful story, overly grindy and RNG-driven progression, and levels that become monotonous and predictable after a few visits. But even so, I found myself gladly sinking dozens of hours into a delightfully weird and unpolished adventure that’s unlike anything I’ve ever played before. Not everyone is going to have the patience to learn the sometimes incoherently complicated systems required to get the most out of Infinity Siege, but those willing to make the effort are in from a very good time.
================================================================================

Game: Millennia
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/millennia-review
Verdict: I felt the same way finishing up a game of Millennia as I did finishing a game of Humankind: It made me want to play Civilization 5 again. Several have tried to claim the turn-based history crown at this point, but none have done it better than Firaxis. And while things like city needs, National Spirits, and production chains allow Millennia to stand out, they don't really let it stand up under its own weight. I think Percy Shelly said it best: Round the decay of that colossal wreck, limited game set-up options, horrid late-game performance, and a cumbersome tile economy, the lone and level sands stretch far away.
================================================================================

Game: South Park: Snow Day!
Score: 3
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-snow-day-review
Verdict: Thanks to recent successes, we know exactly what a great South Park game looks like, and South Park: Snow Day! couldn’t be farther from it. I’m a huge fan of throwing out the rulebook to try something completely fresh, especially in this age of samey sequels and forever live-service games that increasingly play it safe, but this bold attempt at a new direction misses the mark so drastically I’m aghast at just how sideways things went. Whether it’s due to the thoroughly unenjoyable combat or the uncharacteristicly toothless and unfunny story, I can’t recommend anyone waste their time on this cooperative lost cause – even my fellow die-hard South Park fans.
================================================================================

Game: Dragon's Dogma 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review
Verdict: Dragon’s Dogma 2 is a strange and wonderful game that seems haunted by some of yesteryear’s bugaboos. It is a retelling and reimplementation of all of those wonderful ideas from the 2012 cult-classic, including an awesome dynamic world and some of the best combat in the genre that integrates a subtle but amazingly complex physics system. On the other hand, its finicky ally AI, clunky climbing, choppy frame rate, and camera with a habit of going haywire at the worst times are all “features” I wish hadn’t been brought back for another round. Even so, there’s an action-RPG here that’s richly rewarding and incomparable to its contemporaries if you can be patient with its quirks and open to embracing its hands-off open-world and quest designs.
================================================================================

Game: Alone in the Dark
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/alone-in-the-dark-review
Verdict: Like a Louisiana voodoo priestess, Alone in the Dark is not without its charms, but its basic combat lacks the flexibility and function of Resident Evil 4, its inventive narrative is never as mind-bending as Alan Wake II, its uninspired creature design can’t compete with Dead Space, and it’s not nearly as scary as any of them. Its central mystery intrigued me enough to lure me through its strand of imaginative settings all the way to its story’s end as Edward, and its puzzle design did feel consistently rewarding, but I was disappointed to discover that there wasn’t a substantial enough difference to make a repeat playthrough as Emily feel particularly worthwhile. While this remake is undoubtedly a step up from the three-decades-old original, Alone in the Dark fails to escape the shadows of the other contemporary survival horror titans that it helped spawn.
================================================================================

Game: Backpack Battles Early Access
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/backpack-battles-early-access-review
Verdict: Backpack Battles has a strong foundation, smartly mixing the satisfying puzzle of inventory organization with some clever RPG elements and autobattler combat. The systems and ideas in place offer something refreshing, although its current barebones state leaves a lot of potential on the table. As it stands, there's a noticeable lack of content and few reasons to come back to it after you've seen everything once. What's there is enjoyable, though, with plenty of room to grow, and my time with the Early Access build of Backpack Battles has me excited to see it do just that.
================================================================================

Game: Tribes 3: Rivals Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tribes-3-rivals-early-access-review
Verdict: Tribes 3: Rivals is a return to form for a series I’ve long-adored that absolutely nails the most essential parts of this iconic high-speed murder fiesta – but in its current Early Access state, it’s also missing a whole lot that its predecessors pulled off so well, from alternate game modes to vehicles. I’ve had a blast relearning the ropes and becoming a badass titan of the skies once more, despite weird party size limitations and the odd bug here and there, and I’m hopeful the planned ongoing development will make this a more fully featured sequel. But for now, much like controlling the jetpack-powered commandos it stars, Tribes 3 is a really fun time that threatens to run out of fuel quite quickly.
================================================================================

Game: Lightyear Frontier Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lightyear-frontier-early-access-review
Verdict: Lightyear Frontier is already a fun farming and crafting game that takes some pretty simple genre basics and makes them exciting again by putting you in a big ol' stompy robot suit. Things can start a little slow and the story definitely ends too early as of its Early Access launch, but the charming world to explore and make your own outshines its current limitations.
================================================================================

Game: Outcast: A New Beginning
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/outcast-a-new-beginning-review
Verdict: Thanks to its wildly customizable weapons and versatile Iron Man-like jetpack, Outcast: A New Beginning actually does feel like the start of an open-world adventure that’s different from pretty much everything else out there. It’s clearly not a big-budget game, but the freedom it gives you and its ability to laugh at itself make up for a lot of its weaknesses, such as character animations and some overly long questlines filled with busywork. Once you get to know the Talans and appreciate their goofy sci-fi babble, this becomes a charming and colorful world to spend a few dozen hours blasting robots in.
================================================================================

Game: Contra: Operation Galuga
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/contra-operation-galuga-review
Verdict: Contra: Operation Galuga met my expectations as a marginally modernized run-and-gun arcade game, but it almost never exceeded them. All eight levels do a solid job of playing to my Contra nostalgia, and small tweaks to combat like the weapon upgrade and overload systems add a couple of much-needed wrinkles to its otherwise extremely faithful formula. But with only a few hours worth of things to do and very few surprises to be found, the rollercoaster comes to a halt too quickly and doesn’t have many drops or loop-de-loops to enjoy.
================================================================================

Game: Balatro
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review
Verdict: Remarkably approachable with complex systems waiting for those willing to lose themselves to it, Balatro successfully assembles the infinitely fun gameplay loop that every great roguelike sets out to create. It takes the fundamentally simple nature of poker’s scoring hands and shuffles in deep mechanics that don’t feel like a chore to learn but are always thrilling to exploit. A deck-builder of endlessly satisfying proportions, it's the sort of fun that threatens to derail whole weekend plans as you stay awake far too late staring into the eyes of a jester tempting you in for just one more run. Simply put, Balatro is no joker, but in fact, ace.
================================================================================

Game: Nightingale Early Access
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/nightingale-early-access-review
Verdict: Nightingale has a lot of good ideas at its Early Access launch, but they all seem to come with unfortunate caveats. The ability to create and jump to different types of realms offers almost limitless exploration, but it also means they all feel too much like the same randomized bits smashed together. The setting and concept is really interesting, but not much is done with it yet outside of your charming guide, Puck. There’s an excellent crafting system that ties seamlessly into your overall progression, but that progress is halted with painfully long periods of fetching materials and farming Essences too often. Nightingale is almost equal parts fun and infuriating, and as interesting as it is to explore the Fae Realms, anyone taking the plunge right now should be prepared for some frustration.
================================================================================

Game: Expeditions: A MudRunner Game
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review
Verdict: Expeditions: A MudRunner Game certainly isn’t a replacement for the supremely addictive SnowRunner, but its more untamed wilderness maps and huge truckload of exploration-focused missions do see it function as a very worthwhile complementary experience – despite some aggravating mission gating and a bit of an unfriendly map screen. Its unique brand of slow-paced bushwhacking won’t ever be for everybody, but successfully taking a truck on a trek through terrain that the toughest trailblazers would fear to tread is still an oddly satisfying challenge that proves the journey is always more important than the destination.
================================================================================

Game: The Thaumaturge
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-thaumaturge-review
Verdict: The Thaumaturge is a slow, text heavy caper that is often curious and sometimes captivating, weaving revolutionary labor politics and mysticism together to create a unique and charming piece of historical science fiction. It is eurojank through and through, filled with criss-crossing systems like gathering observations, Thaumaturge abilities, and combat that are all fun and engaging despite the sometimes hitchy controls, clunky conversations, and odd voice overs that make this journey a bumpy one. But if a little jank didn’t stop you from enjoying RPGs like Vampyr or The Witcher, you’ll be well equipped for this otherwise exciting ghost story.
================================================================================

Game: The Outlast Trials
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outlast-trials-review
Verdict: As it exits Early Access, The Outlast Trials is a really enjoyable and unique cooperative horror game, but it runs out of runway more quickly than I would have liked. Each of the five stages are memorable and wildly entertaining thanks to their over-the-top horror (despite repeatedly reused antagonists), and the enemy AI is aggressive enough that I was always on my toes. But with just five levels and two main bosses, there isn’t much variety available to support all of the progression that’s in store, and even all of the neat upgrades to chase and some truly devious difficulty options that unlock after your first run through each of the stages can’t jolt life back into them. Some more meat on the bones of the story would have gone a long way to keeping my interest long term, but that’s little more than a skeleton. There are plenty of fun, grotesque memories to be forged in the first few hours of murderous bliss The Outlast Trials provides, but that novelty quickly subsides once you’ve seen everything once.
================================================================================

Game: Terminator: Dark Fate
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-dark-fate-defiance-review
Verdict: Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance is an RTS that tries its best to bring a vicious, dirty, gritty war between humans and machines to life. It delivers flashes of that promise in motion, but lets itself down with obnoxious missions designed around inconsistent rules. Couple that with a confused campaign structure and anemic multiplayer skirmishes, and this otherwise appealing idea tips into the better-left-unplayed pile.
================================================================================

Game: Sons of the Forest
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-review
Verdict: Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better. And considering how much I enjoyed the original, I can easily recommend this strong follow-up. Exploring a huge, beautiful, deadly island through the changing seasons is a treat on its own. The new base building mechanics could entertain me for days without ever touching the main story. And to top it all off, we have smarter and more unsettling enemy behavior paired with thoughtfully improved combat. The technical polish and touched up story since its Early Access release round out what is easily one of my favorite open world survival crafting games ever.
================================================================================

Game: Last Epoch
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-review
Verdict: Last Epoch is an impressive, time-bending action RPG that combines rich customization with modern action. In the mechanical sense, it serves as an important stepping stone between Diablo and Path of Exile – but even without making direct comparisons, it competently stands on its own merits thanks to a flurry of unique, intertwining systems and a strong endgame that make it difficult to resist pouring an entire weekend into its endless loops. Just don’t let its poorly told story or the handful of bugs that have yet to be squashed discourage you from seeing this adventure through to the end of time.
================================================================================

Game: Pacific Drive
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/pacific-drive-review
Verdict: A singular survival game steeped in an unnerving world, Pacific Drive pairs meticulous management with intense excursions that will test your motoring mettle. Balancing its symphony of systems can sometimes be an overly punishing process, but the riveting tension of each run was enough to keep me on my toes even through some repetitious pain points. And when my battered station wagon came screaming out of the portal to safety with no doors and a dead engine, I always felt compelled to fix its faults, buckle back in, and maybe play with the Laika bobblehead on the dash. That frustrating hunk of metal was mine, after all.
================================================================================

Game: Helldivers 2
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review
Verdict: Helldivers 2 is the rare modern multiplayer game that does almost everything right. It gives you a ton of freedom, feels fantastic to play, and has a smart progression system that doesn’t nickel and dime you or rely too much on a paid battle pass. It manages to keep its missions fresh by introducing a ton of enemies, modifiers, and objectives, and varying them in interesting ways. There are some matchmaking and performance issues that still need to be worked out, and you can only go so far by yourself or with random players – but if you’ve got a solid squad, it’s an incredible time, and certainly one of the most fun multiplayer shooters I’ve played in years. When I’m not Helldiving, I’m thinking about Helldiving, counting down the time until my next drop. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pour myself a nice, hot cup of Liber-tea and get back at it. Those bugs and robots look like they could use some freedom, and Managed Democracy isn’t going to spread itself. For Super Earth!
================================================================================

Game: Skull and Bones
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-review
Verdict: Skull and Bones isn’t the successor to Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that many seem to want, and it isn’t many of things Ubisoft itself said it would be at various points in its storied history, but the seafaring RPG we ultimately got is still surprisingly good. Sailing around the Indian Ocean firing cannons, mortars, and giant ballista at your foes is a fun time, the RPG mechanics and cooperative buildcrafting is as deep as the ocean with plenty of awesome gadgets to grind for, and the economy simulator is impressively in-depth. It doesn’t quite fulfill the promise of a decade-long cruise to port yet either, with a thin endgame, almost no story to speak of, and general instability that sometimes makes the adventure feel like a rough draft. But here’s hoping some of those shortcomings can be washed away by the waves of content already planned to come in an ambitious live-service roadmap that’s fast approaching. For now, its maiden voyage is a good start.
================================================================================

Game: Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor Early Access
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review
Verdict: While Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor’s Early Access status is clear in the limited number of modes and maps it currently contains, it doesn't feel unpolished or annoying to play at all. Translating the adventurous, raucous, party game spirit of its shooter big brother to a single-player roguelite about as well as anyone could have, it's an enjoyable addition to one of my favorite franchises. Whether it’s first-person or top-down, wielding a small arsenal of wonderful, punchy weapons as I sprint through critter-filled caverns on my murderous quest for loot and glory warms my stony heart.

Game: Atomic Heart: Trapped in Limbo
Score: 3
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/atomic-heart-trapped-in-limbo-review
Verdict: Atomic Heart: Trapped in Limbo may be wild and wacky to look at, but playing it is a huge disappointment. Beginning as a candy-coated version of Counter-Strike’s surfing and ending as an exhausting Temple Run clone, this DLC add-on stretches its limited ideas into an equally limited set of levels that seem to get less fun the longer they go on. Much as I appreciate the idea of expanding on both of the main campaign’s endings, if this is the result then it should’ve been left on the drawing board.
================================================================================

Game: Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review
Verdict: Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is a fun action game with a solid concept and a stellar paranormal investigation system. Its story about struggling to let go of loved ones in death is worth hearing, even when its pacing occasionally gets sluggish and indulgent. The combat system also tries some interesting new things that largely work out, only dragged down by poor enemy variety and wonky controls. Still, swapping between the corporeal and ghostly planes instantaneously is every bit as cool when solving mysteries as it is during fights, and the writing and characters help carry Banishers across its rougher patches. That made saying goodbye to them fittingly difficult, decaying flesh and all.
================================================================================

Game: The Inquisitor
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-inquisitor-review
Verdict: The Inquisitor takes place in a fascinating, dark world, and its story often puts you in strange and interesting situations. Searching for a vampire and trying to solve murders in a medieval town is a great idea, and it's compelling to search a scene for clues, to try to puzzle out the best choices in conversations and interrogations, and to attempt to stitch the whole thing together. But it doesn't pay off its ambition, whether that’s because of action scenes that are never really challenging or choices that are either too opaque to see where they're taking you, or take you to the same destination regardless of what you pick. The Inquisitor is always holding your hand too tightly as it points you at clues and destinations, and as a result, it's a detective game that does most of the detecting for you.
================================================================================

Game: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review
Verdict: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a thoroughly frustrating game to play. There are things to enjoy here, with combat that’s snappy enough to carry it through a genuinely good DC comics story artfully dressed in high production values. But everything else just falls down around it. Engaging mission design is nearly non-existent, the looter-shooter mechanics are tired and dull, and the grotesquely-repetitive postgame leaves little-to-nothing to do of interest. The result is a bit of a mess that doesn't ever impress with any of its numerous ill-conceived ideas. It's not bad, it's just disappointing from Rocksteady - pioneers of single-player story action chasing already outdated multiplayer trends. A City of Tomorrow built on the unstable foundations of yesterday.
================================================================================

Game: Granblue Fantasy: Relink
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/granblue-fantasy-relink-review
Verdict: Granblue Fantasy: Relink bucks the RPG genre’s usual trend of long and slow-paced stories, but the relative brevity of its campaign doesn’t compromise on the quality of its storytelling. Its mobile game origins don’t always translate over well, feeling a little thin in some aspects, but questing with friends in multiplayer is very exciting – even if the lack of crossplay is disappointing. However, Relink’s fun action combat and interesting cast of characters has kept me happily playing long after I beat the final boss.
================================================================================

Game: Persona 3 Reload
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review
Verdict: A stellar visual overhaul and countless small changes and additions beyond it leave a significant impact, making Persona 3 Reload a more fully realized version of a beloved RPG. Although still dated in some respects, quality of life improvements and new features refresh its exciting turn-based combat and add depth to its touching story moments. Through an incredible new voice cast that embodies these unforgettable characters and an endearing soundtrack to reforge its identity, Persona 3 Reload tells a powerful, timeless story of tragedy and hope with sharp emotional sincerity. This is the kind of remake I’ve hoped for, and even after spending 70 hours to see it all the way to its conclusion, I still find it hard to believe it's real.
================================================================================

Game: Palworld Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-review-xbox-game-pass
Verdict: The version of Palworld on Xbox and the Microsoft Store might not be nearly as polished as the Steam version, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t still a ton of fun. Performance is obviously worse, the audio issues are glaring, you won’t be able to nickname your beloved Pals, and you’re limited to a much smaller group of friends. All of that adds up to an experience that is indisputably worse, but I was at least able to look past the vast majority of these bumps in the road with relative ease, because underneath it all is the same awesome survival game that I haven’t been able to put down. Given time, I fully expect the Xbox-specific issues to get cleaned up as this Early Access dark horse continues to evolve – until then, Xbox players still have a solid game on their hands.
================================================================================

Game: Enshrouded Early Access
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/enshrouded-review
Verdict: Enshrouded will likely be an instant hit for anyone who’s ever wanted to build a castle in a fantasy world full of danger, and it makes all that building fun and easy with an intuitive set of tools. But even if you don’t care much about crafting or building, Enshrouded’s RPG systems are already solid enough to carry you through its open world for a few dozen hours – even if its vague story isn’t all that powerful, its puzzles are forgettable, and its combat and movement systems could use some fine-tuning. Thankfully, there’s usually no pressure to do anything but try to unlock the next visually-breathtaking area, and that made for a smooth 62-hour journey.
================================================================================

Game: Stargate: Timekeepers
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/stargate-timekeepers-review
Verdict: I'm pretty pleased with the first seven episodes of Stargate: Timekeepers. SG-1 and Atlantis have been off the air for 15 years now, and it sounds like we won't be getting any more Shadow Tactics games. So to get an experience that combines both of those bygone things I adore so effectively is a great surprise. I wish the story and characters had a bit more depth to them, and there are some issues with enemy behavior and missing keyboard shortcuts that could use a bit more polish. But overall, I would gladly venture forth through this stargate again.
================================================================================

Game: Palworld Early Access
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-review
Verdict: Even in its Early Access state, Palworld is amusingly irreverent, has a surprising amount of content and deep survival mechanics, and is absurdly difficult to put down. It’s impossible to overlook just how shamelessly it takes ideas and designs from Pokémon, it’s got some unsurprising bugs and performance issues, and the work of keeping your base’s supplies topped off needs a little retuning – but when you’re riding on the back of a flying dragon while shooting a blue duck with an assault rifle, most of those blemishes wash away entirely. This is already one of my favorite survival games, and I’m incredibly excited to see how it evolves.
================================================================================

Game: Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review
Verdict: Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth’s overhauled combat system injects some welcome flexibility and flash into every turn, its difficulty curve has been pruned of nasty spikes to remove the need for repetitive grinding we endured in the last turn-based game, and its spectacular Hawaiian setting is crammed with enough enjoyable activities to overload even the most ambitious of holiday itineraries. A compelling, country-hopping crime story kept me on the hook like a freshly lured barracuda for the 50 hours it took to complete, and the vibrant new job classes and unique combat arenas ensured that the fighting continued to feel fresh. Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series.
================================================================================

Game: Tekken 8
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review
Verdict: Tekken 8 is an amazing new entry in the long-running series. Interesting tweaks to its classic fighting systems, a full suite of fun offline modes, great new characters, incredible training tools, and a vastly improved online experience all add up to a fighting game I will be playing for many years to come. By honoring its legacy, but continuing to move forward, Tekken 8 manages to stand out as something special.
================================================================================

Game: Turnip Boy Robs a Bank
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/turnip-boy-robs-a-bank-review
Verdict: Turnip Boy has already committed a bunch of crimes, and he does even more in Turnip Boy Robs a Bank. While it’s not much longer than its predecessor and has similar pacing problems towards the end, this sequel has gotten a huge overhaul for the better. It’s changed genres from a dungeon crawler to an action roguelite, with massive improvements to the combat that help make that switch work. And with more quests to complete, more jokes to laugh at, and more secrets to uncover, it still holds onto what made its predecessor so charming. It goes to show that there’s always room for Turnip Boy in our lives, even if he’s killed way more people (veggies?) since the last time we saw him.
================================================================================

Game: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review
Verdict: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown captures not only what made games such as The Sands of Time so good, but it irons out a lot of the little issues that plagued the 3D games in this series by opting for a 2D perspective – and owning it. It also works extremely well as a traditional Metroidvania, sticking with tried-and-true elements of the genre but executing on them with precision. The story can feel a bit jumbled at times, but it's the fast and fun combat system, the tight and satisfying controls, and the stylish look and feel that elevate Sargon’s journey and make The Lost Crown a worthy successor to the best of the Prince of Persia legacy.
================================================================================

Game: Supernormal
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/supernormal-review
Verdict: Despite an uneven start and a woefully predictable story, Supernormal can offer some sincerely spooky scares. The creepy house you'll explore is a tense treat to look at, though that atmosphere can get undercut in the first half by truly terrible writing. It's a shame such a brief game offers so little replayability, but while it's far from a PT killer, Supernormal is at least a decent way for a horror fan to kill a little time. Just don't look behind you.
================================================================================

Game: Rocket Racing
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-rocket-racing-review
Verdict: Rocket Racing is certainly worth a few rounds if you’re already into either Fortnite or arcadey racers, though it doesn’t yet have enough going for it to permanently attract anyone away from other beloved multiplayer games like Rocket League or Mario Kart. Still, its brief races are speedy enough to keep me entertained between other activities, and I love how simple and easy it is to get online buddies playing together across platforms – even though its underdeveloped racing mechanics, lack of content, and absence of local multiplayer mean it struggles to stay fresh for too long.
================================================================================

Game: Silent Hill: Ascension
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-ascension-mid-season-review
Verdict: I can see what Silent Hill: Ascension is trying to be: an interactive horror show in which the audience decides the fate of the characters. Sadly, though, the piecemeal delivery and community vote system mean the story is disjointed at best, and nonsensical at worst. Story progression, character development, and exposition all suffer as a result. No, I don't yet know how the story will resolve itself in several months' time, but I'm not sure I care enough to stick around to find out… and therein lies the problem.
================================================================================

Game: The Finals
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-review
Verdict: The Finals does a great job standing out from the competitive shooter crowd thanks to its fast-paced action, excellent environmental destruction, and gameshow-meets-squad shooter vibes. The way flying through the battlefield with a grappling hook or hulk-smashing through buildings mixes with its strict, objective-based modes is a breath of fresh air. It’s a concern that there are only two of those modes total right now, and it definitely feels like both in-game balance and the overall reward economy need some adjustments. But those are small critiques relative to the outrageous fun and breathtaking spectacle of buildings crumbling around you.
================================================================================

Game: Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review
Verdict: Even in such a banner year for RPGs, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader stands out as one I wouldn't want to have missed. Excellent writing, great combat, and the chance to get up close and personal with some of the most interesting and exciting elements of the 40K universe makes for a stimulating gore-feast of a journey. Its systems are a complicated beast to master and the bugs are numerous and significant, but it speaks to the quality of everything surrounding them that they didn't sour the experience for me more than they did. Owlcat has taken a proud step forward as an RPG developer to keep an augmentic eye on. Count this one among the Imperium's finest.
================================================================================

Game: Resident Evil 4 Remake
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-vr-review
Verdict: Resident Evil 4 Remake VR Mode is yet another great iteration of the iconic survival horror game, and definitely worth playing for anyone searching for grounds to revisit parasite-infested rural Spain. The catch is that translating a third-person shooter into a first-person VR game doesn’t always work as well as one might hope, and some of the ways you interact with the world feel half-baked by the standards set in the VR modes of Biohazard and Village. Even so, this fantastic remake is otherwise as stellar as you might expect in VR form, especially where the incredibly impressive graphics and audio design are concerned. So sure, you’ve probably already played this game before, but one more time through it honestly couldn’t hurt – Resident Evil 4 Remake VR Mode is more than enough reason.
================================================================================

Game: Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-review
Verdict: Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is more than just a simple “version-up” of the original game. It systematically addresses virtually every issue I had with it at launch in 2020 – including replacing the dated, delay-based netcode with excellent rollback, filling out the initially small roster of 11 to an excellent collection of 28 highly unique and varied characters, and adding a number of quality-of-life improvements, like better training tools, character-specific tutorials, and more. Even in a crowded year of excellent fighting games, Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising stands out as one of the best.
================================================================================

Game: Cookie Cutter
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/cookie-cutter-review
Verdict: Despite an occasionally frustrating early game, Cookie Cutter is a thoughtful, creative, and (mostly) approachable metroidvania that embodies all the things you'd expect from the genre with its own distinctive style. If this type of game isn't usually your thing, then its fairly standard structure probably won't do much to win you over, especially when its map can sometimes feel a little less open than it first appears. But as a fast, frantic action game to keep you busy, you could do a lot worse than spending a little quality time with Cherry and her gruesome friends.
================================================================================

Game: House Flipper 2
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/house-flipper-2-review
Verdict: House Flipper 2 takes what made House Flipper weirdly addictive and cleans, paints, and builds its way to a worthwhile iterative upgrade on the renovation sim. A few visual tweaks give it a personality the original never quite managed, while the addition of the sandbox mode will give builders who want more power than paint choices the chance to run wild with their tools.
================================================================================

Game: Fortnite Festival
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review
Verdict: Fortnite Festival forgets the bulk of what really made Rock Band the peak rhythm series of its era and injects the husk that’s leftover full of insidious money-extracting service game tricks and baffling design decisions. With no local shared-screen co-op, it falls at the first hurdle as a worthy peer of Harmonix’s party-game powerhouse. You can’t even see the note highways for the other players you’re online with, leaving the Main Stage mode barely feeling like multiplayer at all – and the Fuser-ish Jam Stage mode feels like a waste of effort entirely, demanding a king’s ransom to collect enough of the disgracefully expensive songs to be able to meaningfully engage with it. Binning karaoke support and charting the singing as button taps on the note highway is bewildering. Does Fortnite Festival have small glimmers of that musical magic Harmonix has been humming for over two decades? Yes. Is it a temporarily compulsive throwback to cult-favourite, controller-only Harmonix curios like Frequency, Amplitude, and Rock Band Blitz? Sure. Can I see myself continuing to play it in its initial state? Not a chance. If Fortnite really is the future of rhythm games, they can beat it.
================================================================================

Game: Lego Fortnite
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-fortnite-review
Verdict: Lego Fortnite is a great entry point into survival games thanks to its cooperative focus (either with friends or helpful NPCs) and its easygoing approach when compared to other, more hardcore games in the genre. The recognizably repetitive grind of climbing the tech tree and growing your village can be quite fun, but right now it feels more like a foundation than a full-fledged game. What's here shows potential, especially with all the possibilities afforded by Lego's construction elements and the idea of custom-made vehicles, but more needs to be added before Lego Fortnite feels like a full set.
================================================================================

Game: The Day Before Early Access
Score: 1
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-review
Verdict: The Day Before is easily one of the worst games I’ve ever played, to the point where I’m afraid to continue running it on my PC. Sure, you could say there are the bones of something coherent here, but even those bones feel splintered and brittle. Its map is lifeless, its enemies are idiotic, its PvP is an exploitable mess, its story is pointless, and its progression is downright infuriating. While the now-defunct developer FNTASTIC said it wasn’t done, certain baseline standards have been established in the years since Early Access became a thing, and this game met none of them. The many mysterious questions around The Day Before’s development will likely go unanswered now that the curtain has fallen a mere four days after its release, leaving the playerbase to fend for itself until the servers are inevitably shut down for good. Steam is already diligently refunding anyone who made the mistake of buying it – and if you didn’t manage to try it, you can count yourself as one of the lucky ones.
================================================================================

Game: The Anacrusis
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-anacrusis-review
Verdict: The Anacrusis borrows so much from Left 4 Dead that it forgets to do its own thing and refuses to benefit from 15 years of co-op shooter evolution. The cool disco aesthetic and alien armies definitely offer a much-needed break from zombie hordes, but that can only get you so far when poor enemy variety, dreadfully boring gunplay, and lifeless levels make shooting your way to the next safe zone an uneventful affair. The 4v4 mode at least offers some good opportunities for an over-the-top alien-slaying competition with friends, but that well runs dry pretty quickly too, and the five short campaign episodes and tacked on horde mode become dull even faster.
================================================================================

Game: Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review
Verdict: Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora features a stunning alien world to explore with a refreshingly uncluttered approach to navigation, countless enemy bases to destroy and Na’vi clan sidequests to complete, and no shortage of exotic flora and fauna to harvest and hunt. However, its combat is pretty one-dimensional, its mission design is a bit on the repetitive side, and its environment is generally lacking in any major surprises beyond visual splendor, meaning that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a solid shooting adventure that’s more inside the box than truly out of this world.
================================================================================

Game: Arizona Sunshine 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/arizona-sunshine-2-review
Verdict: Time and time again, Arizona Sunshine 2 expertly ramps up the pressure of oncoming hordes of zombies and then rewards you with spectacular gore when your bullets and hatchets connect with rotten faces. Its VR shooting and relatively complex reloading mean you always have to be on your toes and thinking about how many bullets are left in your guns as you blast your way through a lengthy, occasionally poignant story about a man and his new four-legged best buddy. The variety of enemy types is pretty limited for a 15-plus-hour game, but there’s enough light puzzle-solving and climbing mixed in to keep it moving along, and the physics glitches provide as much humor as the one-liners and co-op antics.
================================================================================

Game: Lethal Company Early Access
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lethal-company-early-access-review
Verdict: There’s nothing quite like a multiplayer survival-horror game that’s as unceasingly spooky as it is hilariously chaotic – and there are few that manage to balance horror and comedy as well as Lethal Company. Even in its early access phase, this co-op loot hunt manages to transcend its limited content and missing systems, making it a good time for those willing to brave its haunted halls – especially with the volume turned up. Still, there’s no real story to speak of, and its tension is deflated a bit by an unappealing and jankily animated art style, overused dungeon templates, and an unrealized progression system that feels as cold and lifeless as the void. We can expect to see a lot of that get improved on during early access, of course. But what it lacks in features right now, it makes up for by offering a strong survival loop that’s satisfying enough to make me want to stick around and see it get built upon. It’s already well worth trying out with a group of buds.
================================================================================

Game: The Walking Dead: Destinies
Score: 2
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-destinies-review
Verdict: A boring, ugly mess of a game to be avoided at all costs, The Walking Dead: Destinies fails to do anything interesting with the story and characters of the popular TV show it’s based on. While the ghost of a promising concept haunts the periphery – that of making choices different from what happened i the early seasons of the show and watching them play out – its horrendous graphics, weightless combat, repetitive mission design, and as many bugs as zombies reduce Destinies to the gaming equivalent of a biological hazard.
================================================================================

Game: SteamWorld Build
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/steamworld-build-review
Verdict: SteamWorld Build is an enjoyable little city builder that doesn't give you grindy busywork or overstretch itself with bloated padding, focusing on a solid foundation of laying out a city and providing it with supplies. Its underground layer is a cool additional system that has you expanding, improving, and defending your mining operation in a way that matches the laid back pace of the surface nicely. At the same time, SteamWorld Build’s simplicity cuts both ways, and there isn’t much variety on return trips aside from fitting the old bits into new maps. That makes it a refreshing city builder worthy of a few fun weekends, but not a particularly deep one I’m likely to boot up year after year.
================================================================================

Game: Bluey: The Videogame
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/bluey-the-videogame-review
Verdict: Wedged somewhere between Wi-Fi and The Wiggles as one of Australia’s greatest exports, Bluey has been a staggeringly successful animated series. Tens of billions of minutes of the show have been streamed into households in more than 60 countries, and the Heelers have subsequently been transformed into over 1,000 bits of merchandising tat. In an unfortunate turn of events, Bluey: The Videogame feels a lot like another forgettable piece of the latter, hovering somewhere between the countless toys and the tubes of licensed toothpaste. Low on innovation and high on what feels like contractual obligation, Bluey: The Videogame is really a low-effort mobile game masquerading as a mid-price console and PC product. It may absolutely look the part compared to the show itself, but with its assortment of shallow minigames rife with annoying bugs, frustrating controls, and a bafflingly brief runtime of a little over an hour, everywhere else it’s a dog’s breakfast.
================================================================================

Game: Flashback 2
Score: 2
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/flashback-2-review
Verdict: While the original Flashback is an Amiga classic, Flashback 2 can only be described as a meagre sequel. Rehashed story elements, dull and clunky combat, a shockingly modest presentation, peculiar design decisions, and wholly unacceptable technical deficiencies (the bulk of which persist even after two post-release patches) make for an adventure that left me underwhelmed at best and utterly infuriated at worst. While I’ll always feel nostalgic for Conrad Hart’s original adventure, Flashback 2 is unfortunately not the blast from the past I had hoped for – instead, it’s a total misfire.
================================================================================

Game: Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/naruto-x-boruto-ultimate-ninja-storm-connections-review
Verdict: Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections may have the biggest roster and flashiest graphics in the series, but its unenthusiastic re-telling of the source material in what should be a celebration of Naruto, Shippuden, and Boruto falls flat. Even when it’s fun and nostalgic, there’s almost nothing here to make me seek it out over past entries with basically the same fighting system and better single-player stories. If all you want is the newest, biggest, and shiniest way to watch your favorite shinobi battle it out, Ninja Storm Connections at least delivers that. But just because it understands the assignment doesn’t mean its execution gets high marks. Even as someone who dabbles in annual series like Call of Duty and FIFA with friends from time to time, this is the most “just another one of these” games I’ve played in a long time.
================================================================================

Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Zombies
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-zombies-review
Verdict: Operation Deadbolt's attempt to reanimate Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3’s Zombies mode by merging it with the machinery of DMZ isn't always successful, but it's not an inherently bad idea. When you start hitting on the right combinations of difficulty, planning, and random chance, it leads to fun, intense moments that leverage some of the best ideas from both. But what's fun here is frequently undercut by way too much time spent grinding for gear needed to survive the intense enemies in the center of the map, busywork story objectives, and crashes that can kill any desire to play. Operation Deadbolt has great moments of tough battles against gross monsters that had me full of panic and dread, but only if I was willing to put in a lot of time and effort to make them happen.
================================================================================

Game: Assassin's Creed Nexus
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review
Verdict: Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR isn’t just another fragmented tech demo, but a fully realized Assassin’s Creed game that benefits greatly from its new medium and breathes life into the familiar Ubisoft formula. Running across rooftops in Renaissance-era Italy and sneaking through the streets of ancient Athens is a blast, and the fact that none of that made me want to hurl is a testament to just how much Nexus takes advantage of the Meta Quest 3’s shiny new hardware. It’s unfortunate that combat seems like an afterthought compared to the rest of Nexus’s polished systems, and occasional technical issues and immersion-breaking bugs definitely pulled me out of the experience from time to time. Even so, Nexus has reignited my interest in virtual reality, as only dancing through the streets of Venice as Ezio could do – and it feels good to be back.
================================================================================

Game: Modern Warfare 3 Multiplayer
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-multiplayer-review
Verdict: I enjoy Modern Warfare 3’s multiplayer in the same way I’ve enjoyed nearly every one of Call of Duty’s competitive kill-fests. When you get down to it, there are few games out there that can match how this series looks and feels in the heat of a firefight. To its credit, this year’s game has brought back some great maps and made some meaningful tweaks to movement and recoil mechanics. But… that’s kind of it for what you get with Modern Warfare 3’s contributions – there aren’t any big new ideas to change up the same gunbattles we’ve had for years, with the most thrilling one being that cosmetic purchases carry over from Modern Warfare 2, which is only possible because so little has changed. Especially when you put those improvements next to a cumbersome and frustrating new progression system, it’s not enough to get excited about.
================================================================================

Game: The Last Faith
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-faith-review
Verdict: If you’ve already played genre leaders like Blasphemous 2 or Bloodstained, then I see no problem spending some time in the dark and largely derivative world of The Last Faith. I don’t think you’ll leave its samey dungeons or lackluster boss fights with a new favorite action game on your list, but navigating the maze of different areas and busting their big ugly masters is challenging and satisfying. The smattering of spells look fun and the collection weapons is genuinely cool with special abilities that are a blast to let loose, I just wish this game gave you more space to experiment without having to trade combat effectiveness. All that said, The Last Faith is not the pinnacle of what this sort of game has to offer by any stretch, and there are plenty of amazing ones I’d recommend that you play before crossing this one off of your list.
================================================================================

Game: Persona 5 Tactica
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-tactica-review
Verdict: When all is said and done, I had a really good time with Persona 5 Tactica. It's a smaller, easier, less epic experience than its JRPG big brother, but none of that spoils the adventure too much. The combat is quick, clever, and exciting, even if – along with the writing and art style – it seems geared toward younger players or an overall more casual experience. Getting to spend another 40-some hours with my beloved Shujin classmates and bob my head along to some of the best music in video games is well worth my time. Long live the revolution!

Game: My Time at Sandrock
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/my-time-at-sandrock-review
Verdict: Whether collecting resources, building items, or passing the day away playing minigames with townies, My Time at Sandrock is a joy. It's clear the team behind Sandrock took lessons from My Time at Portia to build significant quality-of-life improvements to boost almost every main feature, though dungeon design is still a little too basic to be consistently fun. Even though it doesn't nail everything it attempts and it's got a few odd visual bugs, it's hard to linger on those when the townspeople's golden personalities and Sandrock's general unrelenting dedication to goofiness outshine any minor stumbles. The new multiplayer mode is also another fun way to take on building up this desert town, with different challenges that make playing both it and the campaign a great time.
================================================================================

Game: For the King 2
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-king-2-review
Verdict: For the King 2 is a very simply designed turn-based game that definitely accomplishes its goal: It's an interesting, challenging, and engaging fantasy adventure RPG that can serve up novel experiences solo or cooperatively on the first play or the tenth, with plenty of personality along the way. For all that goodness it's hobbled by an interface that works against what should be very smooth gameplay. The mysteries of where to go, how to find a lost dungeon, or how to defeat a dangerous enemy are fun ones; the mysteries of how and when your Farmer makes a scarecrow, not so much.
================================================================================

Game: Nickelodeon All
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-review
Verdict: Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 finally lives up to its name, standing as an all-star platform fighter. Not only is it a fantastic sequel that takes criticisms of the first game to heart and sends them to the blast zone, it expands way beyond those adjustments. Decent (if samey) single-player options with a good amount of challenge, a training mode clearly made by people who know exactly how to construct a platform-fighting laboratory on a level rarely seen, and stellar rollback netplay bolster a supremely fun fighting system. The excellent new Slime mechanic then elevates it to a new level by introducing a huge amount of creativity to every character in its impressive roster without making it unapproachable for the party game audience. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 belongs among the greats of the platform fighting genre – and the moment I’m done writing this, I’m going back for more.
================================================================================

Game: Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review
Verdict: Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is kind of like the cup of miso soup served before Infinite Wealth’s main course – it delivers an enjoyably familiar flavour that stimulates the appetite, but doesn’t really make for a substantial meal in its own right. It effectively feels like an appropriate lead-in to next year’s game in ways both good and bad – on the one hand, it gives a satisfying bit of back story to account for Kiryu’s presence in Hawaii, but on the other its uninspired substories and rehashed side activities are proof positive that the series is crying out for the seachange that Infinite Wealth looks to provide. That said, Gaiden’s gadget-heavy combat definitely kept me consistently entertained over the course of its compact crime story, so although I was less inclined to search for distractions outside of the destruction, I still enjoyed this latest dose of Kazama Kiryu carnage while it lasted.
================================================================================

Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Single
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review
Verdict: Modern Warfare 3’s campaign commits the biggest sin possible for a globe-trotting action thriller: it's boring. What had the promise to be an intriguingly spun web of mystery instead ends up being a dusty cobweb you'd find at the back of your shed, clinging onto 15-year-old garden toys you once had fun with. It's a pale imitation of the past, made up of underbaked story moments that clash with attempts to introduce new open combat missions designed to encourage player freedom that instead fall flat on their face. Yes, the gunplay is still great and the graphics and sound design are top-tier, but I couldn't help but feel I was playing a shinier, less subtle version of something I've played too many times before. If this is the quality we've come to expect from Call of Duty campaigns, maybe it's for the best if a year or two is taken to reset and raise this low bar back to the heights of old.
================================================================================

Game: The Talos Principle 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-talos-principle-2-review
Verdict: Puzzles are meant to be solved; philosophy deals with something that, inherently, can’t be. That The Talos Principle 2 manages to explore both simultaneously is incredibly impressive. There are issues with the difficulty curve in spots and I wish certain things were more clear, but those complaints pale in comparison to everything The Talos Principle 2 does right. Its puzzles had me saying “I don’t know… I really don’t know,” out loud one moment and shouting “I am the smartest man alive!” moments later; its exploration of philosophy both challenged and supported my existing beliefs and made me consider new ones while managing to add a heck of a lot of books to my reading list; and perhaps most importantly, its thoughtful, heartfelt, and deeply moving story reaffirmed my faith in people, and in what we can accomplish if we are determined, to quote Tennyson, “to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”
================================================================================

Game: The Invincible
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-invincible-review
Verdict: The Invincible is a prime example of trying to fit a square peg of a story into the round hole that is the medium of video games. While the premise and story both contain worthwhile parts, the light, pointless gameplay built around it could be much better, as it lacks any depth to its puzzles and is weighed down by too much tedious walking around lifeless locations that feature impressive backdrops but empty foregrounds that aren't worth exploring. There’s only so much even a likable protagonist like Yasna can do with a story, environment, and mechanics that don’t give you much to do until you’re seven hours in. If you are looking for an enjoyable sci-fi story about space exploration and mystery, your time would likely be better spent simply reading Stanislaw Lem's 1964 novel, The Invincible; at least your imagination won’t be as limited as this game seems to be.
================================================================================

Game: Thirsty Suitors
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/thirsty-suitors-review
Verdict: Thirsty Suitors’ heartfelt story of reconciliation and finding oneself offers intimate conversations that hit close to home. Its dramatic combat kept me engaged with a satisfying combination of turn-based actions and timing-based attacks, and its cooking even more so with the deep connections it earnestly put on display. It also confidently stars non-white characters in a way very few games even come close to, though it can try to say and do a little too much in this single package, making parts of the story feel rushed. But overall, Thirsty Suitors manages a great blend of hilarious antics and genuine conversations that will leave you thinking about your own relationships.
================================================================================

Game: RoboCop: Rogue City
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-review
Verdict: RoboCop: Rogue City is a pitch-perfect throwback to the action movies of the ‘80s. It’s over-the-top violence with charm, largely well put together but rough on the edges. Most importantly, it's a fun way to spend time in a beloved fictional universe that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Blasting at goons as an unstoppable walking machine remains as extremely entertaining as it seemed on the big screen, thanks in part to an impressive commitment to capturing the look and feel of the original film. Mixing in elements like routine police work and side quests does a great job changing the pace, too. Even if it’s not the best example of visual fidelity, and prone to some bugs along the way, that love of RoboCop shines through. This is a solid B movie of a video game, which is exactly what the source material demands.
================================================================================

Game: Dead Island 2: Haus
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-2-haus-dlc-review
Verdict: I enjoyed revisiting Dead Island 2 for an evening of gore-filled good times with its Haus DLC, but with very few additions to shake up gameplay and a surprisingly short runtime, there isn’t much here worth diving  back in to see on its own. It certainly has a few laughs to offer, some beautiful new areas to explore, and a crossbow that’s actually pretty fun to use, but it only took half an hour of fighting the same undead goons from the base game for me to grow sick of them all over again. Unless you’ve got a great desire to drink the Kool-Aid, you might be better off waiting for additional DLC before making a return to Hell-A.
================================================================================

Game: The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review
Verdict: As a big fan of both The Lord of the Rings and survival games, I was enticed by the idea that I can dive into a genre I already know and love with the rich lore of Middle-earth to keep me company (as well as a party of friends), but it’s disappointing to see such a promising concept do little more than a barely passable impression of better games. Combat is dull and repetitive, owing to overused enemy types and braindead AI, and limited mining opportunities or freedom with settlement building throws a wet blanket over the creativity that’s typically a selling point for the genre. Throw in rough technical performance and it becomes difficult to recommend Return to Moria to even my fellow Tolkien stans. There’s a decent game in here somewhere, as the compelling progression loop and chaotic multiplayer capabilities can make for a really good time – I just can’t give you many reasons to pick this survival game over the plethora of better options when it’s only ever by-the-numbers at best.
================================================================================

Game: Alan Wake
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review
Verdict: Alan Wake II delivers one of the boldest and most brain-bending survival-horror storylines this side of Silent Hill 2, presents it with uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers. Even though its skill-upgrade systems seem a little superfluous and there were a few repeated cliches in Saga’s story that stuck in my craw, I nonetheless found both sides of this twisted tale to be endlessly fascinating, frequently fear-inducing, and consistently surprising. Alan Wake II is a superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison.
================================================================================

Game: Stray Souls
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/stray-souls-review
Verdict: Despite a genuinely unsettling introductory chapter, Stray Souls is an ambitious but unsatisfying horror game that never quite gets going. Its characters are shallow and uninteresting, and while the sights and sounds of its world can be impressive, the mystery that unravels within it is told mostly through boring exposition dumps and left unsatisfyingly dangling. With poor optimization, zero polish, and some of the dullest bosses I've ever had the displeasure of fighting, Stray Souls is its own worst enemy, destroying its own subtlety with inelegant scares and tedious combat.
================================================================================

Game: Ghostrunner 2
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/ghostrunner-2-review
Verdict: Ghostrunner 2 is an electric sequel that supercharges everything that was great about the original and elevates it to a whole new level. The lightning fast, skill-heavy, one-hit kill combat is as exciting as ever, packed with even more tricks that give you plenty of new options to approach every scenario. The parkour also remains as smooth as silk, and some of the new motorcycle sequences are among the most exhilarating moments I’ve had all year. Those who didn’t vibe with the intensely reflex-heavy gameplay of the first Ghostrunner probably won’t be swayed by any of these improvements, but if the original was up your alley, I can’t imagine a better sequel than this.
================================================================================

Game: Cities: Skylines 2
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-review
Verdict: Cities: Skylines 2 is not the best game in the lineage of Will Wright's original 1989 classic. The champion is still the original Cities: Skylines, at least for now. If Skylines 2 gets the same incredible post-launch support and additional paid and free content as its predecessor, and if the modding community is allowed to thrive, I think this sequel might come out ahead in the long run. There are so many enjoyable new systems and exciting additions, sadly encased in an awful-looking block of concrete that gets in the way of how much I know I could be loving them. It makes too many promises of realism that its most basic features like zoning can't deliver on. It feels like playing a beta, or a very early Early Access game. Frankly, Skylines 2 could have used another few months in the city planning office. For now, it's more of a fixer-upper.
================================================================================

Game: Laika: Aged Through Blood
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/laika-aged-through-blood-review
Verdict: Laika: Aged Through Blood is an unrelenting motorcycle ride through a bloody wasteland with one of the most unique and compelling spins on the metroidvania genre. It expertly blends ruthless death-defying combat with a beautiful hand-painted side scrolling world with a riveting story of revenge, desperation, and survival. Though uncompromising in its insistence that you quickly become adept at handling your bike in addition to taking on multiple threats, a heaping helping of checkpoints guarantees revenge is always within striking distance. If you’ve ever considered yourself a fan of exploring and platforming across 2D landscapes, you’ll find these open roads well worth your time.
================================================================================

Game: Hellboy Web of Wyrd
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-review
Verdict: Missed opportunity haunts every inch of Hellboy Web of Wyrd. Its faithful adaptation of the striking look and sharp wit of Mignola’s classic comic books is excellent, but the focus on action above all else comes at the cost of any real resonance that goes deeper than monster-of-the-week-style pulp. As a brawler, it's simple and fun to dive in and play, but all too soon you reach the bottom of its shallow gameplay, without any room for unique play styles or mechanical discovery and a complete lack of challenging enemies that would demand that you up your demon-slaying game. As a roguelite, I appreciated the short runs that were just long enough not to overstay their welcome, because spending too much time in maps that felt so similar with nothing all that interesting to see and do in them besides slap underpowered bad guys around would be a real purgatory.
================================================================================

Game: Skull Island: Rise of Kong
Score: 3
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-island-rise-of-kong-review
Verdict: Skull Island: Rise of Kong is ugly and full of bugs, but the real trouble is that, at its core, it’s just boring. It makes no meaningful attempts to do anything new or clever, with mindless combat and pointless platforming that make it feel like a worse version of every action game from the last 20 years. This isn't the kind of bad game you can play to laugh at, or that took some cool swings but missed them, or that creates weird combinations of technical snafus that lead to unexpected but entertaining results. It doesn't even rate enough to be called frustrating. Rise of Kong is fundamentally disinterested in itself: a giant ape game that doesn't even care enough about what it's doing to make the ape feel giant.
================================================================================

Game: Wizard with a Gun
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/wizard-with-a-gun-review
Verdict: Wizard with a Gun does what it says on the tin, but not much more. There are tons of cool guns and spells to craft, elemental enemies to defeat, and neat areas to explore. But poor balance in almost every aspect of combat and an unsatisfying ending make a lot of the time spent not seem worthwhile. With some updates and improvements where it counts, Wizard with a Gun could be all that its first few excellent hours set it up to be — but right now it feels incomplete.
================================================================================

Game: Endless Dungeon
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/endless-dungeon-review
Verdict: It requires an almost brash confidence to mash up a twin-stick shooter with a tower defense game, and then further mix that into a sci-fi roguelite. But somehow Endless Dungeon pulls it off, blending them all seamlessly into a great package that strikes just the right balance of action, strategy, and rewarding progression. It can occasionally be frustrating when the random elements stack the deck completely against you, but strong persistent upgrade options make each run still feel like you’ve accomplished something. With a great cast of heroes, a deep roster of monsters, and stellar co-op, Endless Dungeon is an audacious blend that’s worth opening that next door to find.
================================================================================

Game: Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review
Verdict: An impeccably detailed and blisteringly fast racer with incredible graphics and rock-solid arcade underpinnings, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 picks up where the surprisingly excellent 2021 original left off. That is, it’s not just the best thing on the breakfast bench since Micro Machines – it’s one of the strongest and most imaginative arcade racers available today. It’s definitely guilty of forgetting to suitably cater to its wide audience at times, it’s stingy on older cars, and it would’ve been a much bigger and better package if it didn’t completely shed its previous track locations, but the last time Mattel had wheels this worthy of a whirl they were welded beneath Ryan Gosling’s rollerblades.
================================================================================

Game: Sonic Superstars
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review
Verdict: I started hedgehog over heels for Sonic Superstars, but the more time I put into it, the easier it was for me to see its Eggman-sized flaws. The decision to focus more on exploration was a great idea on paper and creates a unique dynamic to each level, but I wish it hadn’t sacrificed speed in exchange. The boss designs are creative and clever, but often wear out their welcome with long periods of being untargetable and occasionally frustrating one-hit KO mechanics. The soundtrack may not have anything as iconic as Hydro City or Spring Yard Zone, but it features some excellent additions to an already long list of Sonic bangers – if only the sound design was up to the same quality standard. And while the campaign is still enjoyable, Superstars’ multiplayer components are far worse options than anything in past Sonic games. Like digging Emeralds out of the rough, Sonic Superstars’ new ideas end up feeling like a mix of both interesting and ill-advised, making it an amusing Sonic game but not exactly a Super one.
================================================================================

Game: Star Trek: Infinite
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/star-trek-infinite-review
Verdict: Star Trek: Infinite does a great job of capturing the look and feel of Star Trek, but those enticing bones splinter under the weight of its bugs and glitches. Each Major Power feels distinct, Mission Trees add choices and story elements to encourage you to roleplay your faction a certain way, and the consistent date and map set-up provides room for experimentation and familiarity in each new run. But that doesn’t matter much if none of it works properly. I have yet to play a single game where I haven’t encountered a backbreaking bug that either halts my progress entirely or cuts me out of fundamental features, whether that’s integrating another civilization into my own or simply building my ships. The end result often feels a lot more like The Original Series than The Next Generation. You can see the promise here, but it’s held back by so many problems that it can be hard to enjoy. Maybe these issues will get patched and sorted out with time, but right now this is a journey into the unknown you’re better off avoiding.
================================================================================

Game: Lords of the Fallen
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-review-2023
Verdict: Lords of the Fallen is a great soulslike, and its killer new idea of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is an excellent twist to set it apart from the pack. That concept is unfortunately hamstrung by numerous, highly annoying technical issues and weak boss fights, but awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting more than make up for those shortcomings. If, like me, you’re a sucker for a quality action-RPG even amid a clear overabundance of them, then this reboot is well worth your time.
================================================================================

Game: Total War: Pharaoh
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-pharaoh-review
Verdict: Total War: Pharaoh looks incredible, with diverse and interesting battles complemented by an uncommonly deep and rich campaign layer. The focus is firmly on Egypt, and the experiences available outside that region don't really match up in terms of content or quality to what is on offer to the civilizations of the Nile. But when I'm sailing up and down that majestic river, fending off invasions from hostile tribes, politicking my way to the top of the power pyramid, and sending my besandaled soldiers to spill blood across the shining sands, I feel confident in saying historical Total War is back, baby. Creative Assembly Sophia has refined every part of its take on this franchise since Troy, and the results are just shy of glorious.
================================================================================

Game: Cricket 24
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/cricket-24-review
Verdict: Cricket 24 is a bit like English opener Rory Burns. That is, capable of quality play for decent periods – and getting the job done despite looking a little peculiar at times – but a bit too inconsistent overall to be considered an automatic selection. Since developer Big Ant Studios’ has previously displayed a penchant for post-release tweaking, future updates may well address a lot of the lingering issues with licensed players and smooth out the rough edges of its AI and presentation, and in six months’ time this could potentially be a simulation worth going into bat for. However, as of right now Cricket 24 is a disappointingly modest and often slipshod update that seemingly lacks the confidence or creativity to advance further down the wicket.
================================================================================

Game: Assassin's Creed Mirage
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-review
Verdict: Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s return to the stealthy style that launched this series doesn’t do everything right, but everything it does feels like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited selection of gear to play with – all of which I found refreshing relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey and Valhalla. It also means an overly simplistic plot with mostly forgettable characters, but what the story lacks in depth it makes up for with its straightforward quest progression and fast pacing. Though there's no big standout “wow” moment, Baghdad is a beautiful location in its own right, and the world’s detail is focused inward, making every alley and hovel feel well traveled and full of detail and history. I’d recommend Mirage to anyone who’s lapsed on Assassin’s Creed, as its back-to-basics approach is a successful first step in returning the feeling that the earlier industry-defining games gave me so long ago.
================================================================================

Game: Forza Motorsport
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-review
Verdict: After six long years, Forza Motorsport is off the lift and back in our lives. It looks great, feels great, sounds great, and it’s brought with it the most impressive multiplayer we’ve seen in the series so far. With 500 cars and 20 track locations it’s hardly a small start but, now positioned as a platform, Forza Motorsport has the potential to expand into a seriously rich racing destination over the coming years. If Flight Simulator on four wheels is the plan, I’m here for it. First on the list of improvements Turn 10 should focus on is revamping the new RPG-inspired upgrade system that turns progression into an unnecessarily long road ahead of each individual car, and maybe bringing back the joys of split-screen multiplayer racing to complement the excellent online modes.
================================================================================

Game: Station to Station
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/station-to-station-review
Verdict: Station to Station is a relaxing, cozy railway planner with clear goals, flexibility in how you accomplish them, and the absolute perfect amount of challenge. It doesn't try to be anything more than a fun and easy going experience, and the fact you can randomize levels and crank their difficulty up a bit provides some nice variety to how you approach each session. I love its voxel-based graphics so much, the music is soothing, and it just oozes charm. Even failing a level didn’t frustrate, because it just meant I got another opportunity to roll through the blocky countryside and do a little better. Its biggest strength lies in its simplicity, and it doesn't stray too far from that initial gameplay premise. Honestly, it doesn't have to.
================================================================================

Game: High On Life: High on Knife
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-high-on-knife-dlc-review
Verdict: High on Knife is a decent add-on for those searching for an excuse to jump back into Squanch Games’ gross world of naughty words and cartoon violence, but it doesn’t offer a whole lot of reasons to stick around for more than a couple of hours. With a disappointingly short questline and an ill-advised focus on some of the weaker members of the High on Life cast, it doesn’t come close to reaching the same highs (pun intended) as it did last year. There are certainly some decent laughs to be had, and more of this shamelessly idiotic world is by no means a bad thing, but there just isn’t enough here for me to be able to enthusiastically recommend anyone clear even this small amount of time on their busy gaming schedule.
================================================================================

Game: Avatar: The Last Airbender
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-quest-for-balance-review
Verdict: We haven’t quite been waiting 100 years for an Avatar game that lives up to the potential of the show, but it’s certainly beginning to feel that way after playing Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance. This half-baked and wildly inconsistent retelling of the excellent TV series shows the promise of what an Avatar game could maybe be, but a baffling choice of which scenes to highlight, a clunky camera and combat, hilarious balance problems, and an overreliance on middling block puzzles and boring fetch quests leaves our search for the real Avatar still desperately out of luck. With more Avatar shows and movies on the way, it’s just downright odd how Quest for Balance has managed to arrive at this point in time as both an unsatisfying entry point for newcomers and a poor way to revisit it for dedicated fans.
================================================================================

Game: Cocoon
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/cocoon-review
Verdict: Cocoon is a breathtaking puzzle-platformer that borders on psychedelic. Building on what made Inside designer Jeppe Carlsen's previous work stand out, Cocoon not only presents a mind-bending journey through the cosmos via fascinating worlds-within-worlds puzzle mechanics that beg you to delve another layer deeper, but an interesting take on the repetition of work, life, and being part of a "bigger picture." With a relatively short playtime and some well-hidden collectibles that make it worth replaying, Cocoon is a must-play for fans of Limbo or Inside, or anyone looking for a new puzzle adventure to play and then sit down and think about for a while.
================================================================================

Game: The Lamplighters League
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lamplighters-league-review
Verdict: The Lamplighters League takes proven concepts from other tactics games and puts them together into a novel blend. It takes an unfortunate amount of time to get going, but once it does the tight, meaningful strategic layer ensures that every mission, no matter how banal, matters to your overall campaign. The superb enemy and hero design gives you great stuff to work with as you use real-time stealth takedowns to prepare for tactical fights. Sure, sometimes the partially procedurally generated maps throw up a frustrating scenario, or an ability works a bit weird, but I was more than happy to take those in stride in order to undertake a globetrotting pulp adventure in such an interesting and engaging world.
================================================================================

Game: Wargroove 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/wargroove-2-review
Verdict: Wargroove 2 is a lot bigger, even if its tactical combat isn’t much better to match – but with how good the original Wargroove was already, that’s forgivable. The story of its three campaigns isn’t as cohesive as its predecessor and there aren’t many truly new gameplay features in the campaign levels themselves, but its Advance Wars-style tactical combat once again manages to make the hours fly by.A satisfyingly challenging new roguelike mode also provides a new way to play that could have practically been a whole game of its own. It’s a familiar package even with that mode, but if you loved the original then Wargroove 2 provides a whole lot more of what made it so great.
================================================================================

Game: Super Bomberman R 2
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/super-bomberman-r-2-review
Verdict: Super Bomberman R 2's extensive set of classically entertaining multiplayer modes, powerful but frustrating level editor, and fun customization options give you more than enough to do to make up for the dull story mode. Though it doesn't completely atone for its predecessor's throwaway plot, simplistic character models, and lack of content, it changes things up enough to court both new and old fans. With its large-scale Battle 64 battle royale and a new tower defense-inspired Castle mode, it’s worth playing for a few new spins on the age-old idea of blowing your friends up.
================================================================================

Game: Mineko's Night Market
Score: 5
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/minekos-night-market-review
Verdict: Mineko’s Night Market is an adorable little sim that could’ve been cozy, but is mostly just boring chores that don’t reward you in the kinds of satisfying ways we see in other popular games in this relaxed genre. After putting you to work, it doesn’t let up, trapping you in a grind of gathering resources and making crafts for lifeless NPCs. Beyond some purring cats, gorgeous artwork, and a handful of legitimately funny bits, it doesn’t provide anything to make all your work worth it.
================================================================================

Game: The Making of Karateka
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-making-of-karateka-review
Verdict: Before playing The Making of Karateka, I had no interest in Karateka beyond it being a historical stepping stone to Prince of Persia. But I get it now. I I see its many parts: The animation that was hand drawn from Jordan Mechner’’s snapshots of his family’s karate instructor; the music that began as a fatherly lesson in Wagner’s leitmotifs; and the cinematic framing of a story that cuts between scenes in a far more complicated way than, say, the “They Meet” cutscene in Ms. Pac-Man. Karateka is significant, but the story behind it is remarkable, and The Making of Karateka tells that story in the coolest way possible.
================================================================================

Game: Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways
Score: 9

Verdict: Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways lifts up and reinvents Ada Wong’s story much the same way the Resident Evil 4 Remake itself did for Leon Kennedy. The relatively short four-hour runtime leaves very little room for the action-packed adventure to make a misstep, and it never does: levels are familiar but feel new, encounters and boss fights are reworked and fantastically varied, Ada’s grapple gun abilities feel right at home alongside the remake’s new features, and surprises wait in store even for die-hard Resident Evil fans who think they’ve seen everything. As modestly sized DLC expansions go, it’s hard to ask for much more than this.

Game: Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review
Verdict: Last year, I said in my review of Cyberpunk Edgerunners that CDPR now has a blueprint for where to go with Cyberpunk 2077, and Phantom Liberty shows the studio already had exactly that in mind. Between a more sophisticated level of storytelling with excellent performances, smarter insights on the cyberpunk genre and its dystopian themes, and landing on top of a much-improved gameplay experience thanks to its fresh 2.0 update, Phantom Liberty marks a new chapter for Cyberpunk 2077 and is finally close to what I’d hoped it would be when I first sat down to play three years ago.
================================================================================

Game: Mortal Kombat 1 For Switch
Score: 3
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-for-switch-review
Verdict: Mortal Kombat 1 on the Switch is nowhere close to the experience you’ll have with it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC. There’s a hint of a great fighting game still peeking through the blurry backgrounds, but its horrendous load times, inconsistent framerate, muddy visuals, and plethora of bugs make the Switch version an altogether aggravating way to play what is a great fighting game on other platforms. It quite simply shouldn’t have released in this state, and certainly not at a price that’s equal to the superior, current gen versions.
================================================================================

Game: Payday 3
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-review
Verdict: Payday 3 is a solid step forward for my favorite heist simulator franchise, even though that step is a lot smaller than I’d hoped due to a lack of content and the unsurprising but still majorly annoying bugs and performance issues. The awesome combat, greatly improved AI, and especially the stealth options are so massive they alone justify this as a full sequel, and the new and improved heists with clear phases to navigate them are absolutely fantastic. I just wish there was more loot in the proverbial vault at the outset, and that Starbreeze would have used its years of experience in order to ensure this was a more robust and far more stable launch. I’m confident Payday 3 could become the sequel we all deserve with a year or two of updates – for now, it’s a nice start.
================================================================================

Game: Mortal Kombat 1
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-review
Verdict: Mortal Kombat 1 is another great entry in this legendary series, but it’s not one without issues. The new Kameo system is excellent, there are smart changes to the fighting mechanics that address many of the fundamental issues that cropped up over  Mortal Kombat 11’s life, and predictably, the fantastic single-player story mode that continues to be the gold standard of the genre. But certain elements of online play are starting to feel dated, and Invasions mode is not nearly engaging enough to hold my attention for as long as is needed to unlock a majority of the goodies hidden behind its many treasure chests and gimmicky battles. Still, Mortal Kombat 1 marks a new beginning for the franchise, and it’s a very exciting launching point for the next era.
================================================================================

Game: Party Animals
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/party-animals-review
Verdict: With smooth online multiplayer, a handful of mostly distinct maps, and downright adorable characters, Party Animals delivers a fun party game that brings cuddly, chaotic fun where it counts the most. The intentionally wobbly controls take a moment to get used to, but once you do it’s wonderfully satisfying to land a punch and send another player flying into an environmental hazard for a KO. It does commit an all-too-common cardinal sin for contemporary multiplayer games in making local play less enjoyable than going online, but all three main modes are a good time, especially in a full lobby of eight players.
================================================================================

Game: The Crew Motorfest
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crew-motorfest-review
Verdict: It’s said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. LEGO has Mega Bloks. E.T. has Mac and Me. Now Forza Horizon has The Crew Motorfest. To be fair, Motorfest is a robust racer with a confident sense of style, a quality arcade handling model, and a long list of generally well-planned events right out of the box. However, the shift to a smaller map has seen it lose a part of its old identity, boats and aircraft feel like they’ve been sidelined, and some of its event Playlists work a lot better than others. Ultimately, The Crew Motorfest is a little more Ice Ice Baby and a little less Under Pressure. It’s a catchy enough copy, but it ain’t exactly back with a brand new invention.
================================================================================

Game: Dune: Spice Wars
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-spice-wars-review
Verdict: Dune: Spice Wars is a clever, multilayered, challenging RTS that translates the very essence of what I love about Dune into systems that demonstrate a respect for the lore and an uncommon understanding of interesting strategic gameplay. It looks great, it sounds great, and the pacing is excellent. Every faction is flavorful and different, lending it loads of replayability. The tactical AI could definitely use some work, and not all of the ideas in the Conquest campaign mode landed gracefully. But the fact is: this is my favorite video game set in the Dune universe, and I think I'll be playing it for a long time.
================================================================================

Game: Lies of P
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-review
Verdict: Lies of P might not branch out particularly far from its soulslike inspiration, but like a marionette controlled by a skilled puppet master, it plays the part extremely well in a wonderfully dark fantasy world. It must be said that its uneven difficulty didn’t always make me feel like an underdog, especially when playing as a brawny, overpowered version of Pinocchio with a massive weapon, and combat pigeonholed me into a specific playstyle while the levels are less open and twisting than most. But with an awesome weapon crafting system, some really memorable boss fights, and one of the better stories we’ve seen in this genre, I can enthusiastically recommend you spend your time hanging out with Gepetto and friends. If you’ve been waiting for a Bloodborne remaster or sequel that may never come, Lies of P is the next best thing.
================================================================================

Game: Starfield
Score: 7
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review
Verdict: It’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it out is strong.
================================================================================

Game: Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/trine-5-a-clockwork-conspiracy-review
Verdict: Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy is an awesome sequel that keeps the good times rolling for one of the best co-op puzzle-platformer series out there. This set of puzzles are some of the strongest they’ve ever been, and boss fights are creative and original – even if those highlights are occasionally cut short with snooze-inducing combat sections and a predictable story. It may not do much to innovate beyond what we’ve done four times before, but Trine 5 plays to its strengths extremely well and makes some important tweaks here and there that definitely make it worthy of a playthrough or two.
================================================================================

Game: Sea of Stars
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-stars-review
Verdict: Sea of Stars is an excellent tribute RPG that channels the best parts of its ‘90s-era forebears like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, and even Star Ocean: The Second Story. Because of that, it’s fair to say that its world, graphical style, and mechanics aren’t wholly original, but there are enough interesting twists in its 30-hour story to make for a rich and enjoyable experience of its own merit. This isn’t just nostalgia fodder. That said, its twitchy combat can be difficult to get a handle on, and once you do, it only stays interesting for so long before its limited customization options make it start to feel just a little repetitive. That’s made up for by a strong soundtrack, an approachable and endearing story, and a wide number of fun zones and boss fights that make this a trip worth taking.
================================================================================

Game: Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review
Verdict: Armored Core 6 doesn’t look to reinvent the bipedal legs of the mech action genre, but it does update, refine, and polish them to an aggressive shine. Every sortie is a satisfying combat puzzle to solve thanks to fantastic mission design, intense boss encounters, an extremely wide assortment of weapons and parts that can dramatically affect how your mech plays, and excellent, explosive combat that manages to take very complex systems and mechanics and make them easy to understand and execute. Its interesting premise is stifled by bland storytelling told through mission briefings and radio chatter, but this is still nonetheless a welcome return of a classic mecha series.
================================================================================

Game: Madden
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-24-review
Verdict: Madden NFL 24 makes several much-needed improvements to the on-field experience thanks to fantastic additions to animations and AI, but it still suffers from the same problems it always has once you get off the field: everything here is just done better in every other sports sim, even the other ones made by EA, and this year’s tweaks just aren’t enough to make up for the series’ continued feeling of sameness and lack of progress. To continue the metaphor, Madden feels like a decent but not great football team: content to coast. If it were in the right division I could see it sneaking into the playoffs, or overperforming in a good year. But it’s the kind of team that typically gets eliminated in the first round. The on-field game might be the best it’s ever been, but there are too many off-field issues here to ignore, and with each passing year it feels more and more like they’ll never be fixed. Perpetually, Madden seems like it could be a contender with time and the right changes, but right now it feels like an also-ran. And you don’t win the Super Bowl like that.
================================================================================

Game: Immortals of Aveum
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-of-aveum-review
Verdict: Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet.
================================================================================

Game: Baldur's Gate 3 Final
Score: 10
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review
Verdict: I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3. Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense. But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from, this is absolutely it. I waited 14 years for the stars to align again so that we could get the ideal mix of crunchy, tactical, old-school RPG combat, an epic and well-written story with complex characters and lots of meaningful choices, and a level of polish and cinematic presentation that let me see the sweat and the sorrow on characters' faces in their darkest hours. Plenty of other games have partially completed that list, but the last time they all came together was Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. And I can finally say that game, and its Infinity Engine predecessors, have a worthy successor that’s not just matched their RPG greatness, but surpassed it. Baldur’s Gate 3 is just about everything I could have asked for.
================================================================================

Game: Blasphemous 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/blasphemous-2-review
Verdict: Blasphemous 2 is an excellent Metroidvania and a marked improvement over the original, even if it did occasionally make me cancel my lunch plans with its grotesqueries. What it lacks in originality with its design it more than makes up for with its bizarre world, appalling story, and inspired look and sound. The new weapons and focus on platforming definitely helped sustain my enjoyment for the campaign’s sizable duration, even when underwhelming enemy variety and unchallenging bosses leave something to be desired. Its stomach-churning religious torture porn might be as far as you can get from the adorable world of Hollow Knight, but you’d be hard-pressed to find something better to play while you continue your interminable wait for Silksong.
================================================================================

Game: WrestleQuest
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/wrestlequest-review
Verdict: WrestleQuest is truly an earnest attempt at telling an authentic wrestling tale in old-school RPG format. Competent combat mechanics add flair and depth to a usually pretty banal aspect of this style of game, but much of the depth feels easy to ignore, and the parts that aren't – namely dramatic moments – supply the opposite of a fun challenge. Likewise, it may take a bit of fighting spirit to make it through the slow and arduous dungeons and some of the bloated and jarring plot, yet it captures the intrepid lives of people who travel the world, beating each other up for fame and fortune in charming and touching ways that are enhanced by its Toy Story-style innocence. For being the first attempt at telling a pro wrestling tale in such a story-forward medium, WrestleQuest is championship material – but maybe just a mid-card title.
================================================================================

Game: Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew
Score: 9
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review
Verdict: Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is a peak example of the stealth tactics genre from a studio that is clearly mastering its craft. Its mission structure is spread across excellently entertaining levels with rich detail to find and master, while characters shine with voice performances, endearing humor, and colorful art that both delight and impress. With innumerable ways to approach its levels and an extremely smart integration of the practice of saving and reloading into the world’s fiction, it’s firing on all cylinders in all categories except perhaps enemy AI. Frankly, I don't know anyone I wouldn't recommend it to.
================================================================================

Game: Gord
Score: 4
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/gord-review
Verdict: Any way you look at it, whether it’s an RPG, a real-time strategy game, or a colony sim, Gord is as miserable as its downtrodden villagers. Other games are bad because they aim too high, attempt too much, and fall down on their own merits. They are at the very least hoisted on their own petard, doing us the favor of digging their own grave or being entertaining in their failures. Gord does not; it simply falls flat and rots where it lies, surrounded by monotonous micromanagement, a poor interface, and by-the-numbers combat. I am content to leave it there, but you may bury it if you like.
================================================================================

Game: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Game
Score: 6
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review
Verdict: I have little doubt that in a year or two, when they’ve added more scenarios and maps, fixed the most pressing technical issues, and maybe thought up a better way for newcomers to learn how to play, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will become a staple in my growing asymmetrical horror games library. For now, however, my recommendation comes with a lot of caveats. While the less lopsided take on the asymmetrical horror format definitely works, the shallow number of samey maps can get monotonous pretty quickly, and even with a fair number of playable characters and a solid progression system, I found myself way too comfortable with the three scenarios after just a few hours. Still, the potential behind this format and the reverence for the beloved horror classic it’s based on is clear, even when it does feel a tad half-baked coming out the gates.
================================================================================

Game: Moving Out 2
Score: 8
URL: https://www.ign.com/articles/moving-out-2-review
Verdict: Moving Out 2 is an extremely colourful and calamitous co-op sequel that’s as challenging as it is charming, serving up an enjoyably distinct set of crazy cargo collections that task you with bending at the knees while consistently splitting your sides. Spreading its preposterous brand of pass the parcel across multiple dimensions has empowered the developers to get really creative with the setup of each stage, although that added ambition has meant that some smaller corners have seemingly been cut. Still, the addition of online multiplayer should mean that more players will be able to rope in a moving buddy whether they share the same couch or not, which will hopefully go a long way towards making up for its lingering deficiencies as a single-player experience. If you’re up for another hectic house party with friends, Moving Out 2 hits harder than a thrown fridge.
